(which i honestly don't remember much about that whole thing... maybe it's because my life has been insane ever since... or i just don't dwell on it all... it could be chemo brain too...) annnnyway.... celebrate that you made it! :) life is the best gift and give thanks to those who helped in your recovery :)   i say have cake! :) celebrate that you've survived and kicked ass! :)  (i seriously don't understand how anyone could downvote this! boo on them :p )
t3_2uc0bm-t1_co7dpph-co8plxm	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	sounds like me. i've been diagnosed with ocd, anxiety and depression and although i joke about being a hypochondriac when i go to the doctor with a crazy theory or request for a useless test, they haven't really discussed whether it might actually be true.  like you, i get constipated and bleed a lot and went for a colonoscopy because i thought i had colon cancer. i now use reslor to increase bowel movement and lactulose and movicol to soften things up. i think my main problem in that department is anxiety though.  i also have permanent heart palpitations and a heart rate of over 100 bpm most of the time despite being on medication for ocd, anxiety and depression. i went for 3 ecgs or ekgs and they were all fine apart from the heart rate but i'm still convinced there's something wrong with my heart. i have an app on my phone and use that and a blood pressure monitor to check my heart rate several times per day.  i get sharp pains in my lower abdomen so even though i'm a virgin in my late 20s i was convinced it was cancer or polycystic ovaries. got an ultrasound a few years ago but obviously i still think there's something there. with a bit of rationality it can be attributed to the constipation though.  i don't have the money for an mri of my head but i'm convinced i have a brain tumour.  i pretty much always have a sore throat so i'm convinced i'm going to get throat cancer even though i don't smoke.  i had a breast lump removed even though the biopsy said it was fine because i don't trust the health system at all. i   i think the reason behind it is because as a teenager i had hashimoto's. my immune system had been destroying my thyroid which had me very tired and run down. my mother thought i had anemia or something so i went to the doctor and got a blood test done. i didn't really know what tests to have done so the doctor didn't check my thyroid and so for years i believed that the way i felt was just normal for me and since the doctor didn't find anything wrong with me.  i haven't felt right since i sorted out my thyroid so now every time i go for blood tests i ask for different tests to be done like checking for other auto-immune disorders, checking for liver function etc.  my antibodies are usually always slightly lower than the normal range which i think is harmless enough but i keep trying to figure out what it could be.  i'm a bit of a mess these days, barely able to function and it gets very confusing. the funny thing about my health-related anxiety is that i wish i was dead and have done so since my teens. if it wasn't for the guilt for what i'd be doing to the people i'd leave behind then i'd just kill myself but yet when i think i have a terminal illness i panic and run to the doctor.
t3_14mvdt-t3_14mvdt-c7el5pt	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	it wasn't colon cancer, it was a hernia.  edit backstory: so i went to the bathroom and after i was done i noticed there was a considerable amount of blood in my stool. i had remembered from a previous internet session that one of the symptoms of colon cancer was blood in your stool. so i drove to the doctor and he found that it was just a hernia. it was probably just overreacting but i was still considerably frightened at the thought that i could, possibly, have cancer.  edit 2: i had a major brain fart and wrote hernia all those times when i meant hemorrhoids. it wasn't a hernia, it was hemorrhoids.

t3_4rsii3-t3_4rsii3-d54zq4p	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	my dad died from stage 4 colon cancer. it is terrible. he was 65 at his time of death, they found it when he was 62. i still think it is too young for someone to die, but who am i to say that? we had in-home nurses every two or three days to check on him. my mother and i administered his nutrition through his picc lines, along with antibiotics and any other meds he needed. in his last year he would seem to get better for a few days - walking around and fiddling in his shop, and then he'd be back bed-ridden for a few weeks. in the last 3 weeks of his life, his cancer had spread to his entire body, brain included, aiding in him gaining dementia. it wasn't the "i see angels" type ordeal - i believed he could see those...it was him forgetting my name, thinking i was my sister, thinking his ex-wife was still alive (died in 2004), things of that nature. he then sort of went comatose. he was unresponsive for 4 days, fever on and off (we'd administer medication through his picc to bring it down), and one night he woke up for a few hours while i was gone, told my mama how much he loved her, kissed her, and uttered "i love you" over and over again until he went back to sleep. over the next 3 hours, my sister-in-law (a nurse) stayed by my mom's side checking his heart-rate every 10 minutes. at 5:13 am, he took 4 breaths with a heart rate so low they couldn't count them. 5:14 am, 3 breaths and they could no longer hear his heart. 5:15 am, 2 breaths. 5:16, he took his final breath. you may think i'm lying to you, but in all of the truth i can muster, the clock on the wall beside him froze up at 5:16 and hasn't worked since, even with new batteries.   i'm so sorry for you dealing with this. cancer does truly suck more than anything. i was only able to stay strong because of my mother. he was the only person she ever loved. he saved her from a terrible step-father and an "enabling to the step-father" mother. he was 30, she was 16 (in the 70's). they never left each other's side until his dying day &lt;3
t3_1v4k0w-t3_1v4k0w-ceoyrr8	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	this is not really messed up but it certainly hurt and angered me.    my paternal grandparents lived with us, and i grew up with them through much of my formative years. anyone could see that i loved my grandfather and grandmother dearly. they were not only my family and my elders but also my friends. but my grandfather fell ill in 2010/2011. we discovered that he was battling a malignant brain tumor and that was the cause of his rapid decline in health. he passed away soon after christmas. it fucked up my next few months as i struggled with the first major death in my family (that i could truly relate to).   and i can't remember exactly when but a few years after he passed away, my parents told me that they knew he was battling colon cancer as well (years before the brain tumor was found). i know that i was a kid and they didn't want to burden me but i can't help but think to myself that if i knew this, i could have kind of steeled myself a bit more.    and it's just as painful now.
t3_45x1sc-t1_d00xidv-d00yvr9	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	thanks for the response. i was hoping not to come off quite so cynical, and a bit more inspirational, but hey... part of this was venting my feelings and emotions on this issue, which is really something i've only recently started to do.   i'm glad people can relate to this. i think this should be talked about a lot more, with those of us in this spot, as well as those who are just beginning their journey.  and i've been believing that i had signs of colon cancer for the past few days. it's been a good ride, haha. i've learned to let those pains and discomforts sit for a week or two because 99 times out of 100 they go away and never amount to anything. i've also recently been getting more comfortable going to the dr if my anxiety over something my body is doing gets too bad. i tell him upfront i know i'm probably just crazy, but i'm not going to be shamed out of a doctor visit in fear of being branded as such. he agrees and is more than willing to accommodate. i swear i'm convinced of a brain tumor growing in my head about once a month though.

t3_34ipvk-t3_34ipvk-cqvd9nk	brain_cancer	relevant	0.6725	both my mom and dad had cancer.  dad: started with urinating blood. my mom and i don't know for how long. apparently he wasn't worried about it because he had (not serious) issues with his kidneys that would cause this to happen sometimes. my mom walked in on him urinating blood and forced him to the doctor. turns out it was very very aggressive cancer that jumped from his bladder to his brain and killed him. very rare. only happened in 2 other cases in the world. diagnosed at 49, died at 53.  mom: she started having difficulty pooping. thought she was just constipated but it didn't get better for a long time so i convinced her to get a colonoscopy (this was 2 months after dad died). nothing showed up. so she got a scan. turns out my mom had ovarian cancer...but heres the kicker....she had a full hysterectomy when i was a child. she either had a 3rd ovary or another ovary grew somehow and attached itself to the rectal wall. it was a very aggressive cancer but it was caught early and it was able to be treated. the doctors said she was lucky to have any signs at all because ovarian cancer usually gives no signs, which is why it is so deadly. she is currently in remission. diagnosed at 53, in remission at 57.
t3_25mgqw-t3_25mgqw-chjiybv	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.8331	this is how my dad found colon cancer now i'm constantly terrified of finding cancer myself. my dad waited on his until his insides were practically falling out and went in they said he was way way to far gone and there was no hope. he tried going through chemo and other meds but he just got sicker until he couldn't eat, lost a bunch of weight. he gave up got off all his meds felt a little better and was able to eat again but died shortly after that and still wasnt well. it spread to his brain and he was trapped in his head in a way for a short time before passing. had he gone in sooner he could have had the cancer removed before it had a chance to spread. i hope she is ok.

t3_4c9ie5-t1_d1g64wu-d1h07p8	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7384	i've had skin cancer (it was a scab on a mole, i hurt myself there while checking if it was skin cancer) which i though that had metastasized to my pancreas (yellow-ish stool? no. it was a lighter brown) that i though was pressing on my stomach.   did a checkup: an ultrasound and endoscopy later revealed that i had a common stomach infection (2 weeks on antibiotics), fat liver (also common), hiatus hernia that caused reflux (common).   now i'm debating if i have colon cancer (all i have is rashes after taking shits), and sometimes it appears to be red-ish stool (please... maybe it is my brain thinking it is blood).  this gives me anxiety sometimes. i stopped looking into the symptoms because it'll only make me more alert than usual for nothing. unfortunately digestive tract cancer symptoms can also be regular aging symptoms or bad diet. there is no tell-tale symptom. unless you're pooping pitch black, or pure red. check that shit up (literally).
t3_28nbjv-t1_cid3j3y-cidc5p2	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6063	not a dumb question at all! it depends, but i've been told it is by many doctors. my husband's mother just recovered from colon cancer, (capitalized because that shit is scary), and her doctor told her that all her children should be checked.  my father is checked once a year, because both his father and grandfather have had skin cancer, and his uncle had brain cancer. i haven't had a chance, but i know i should start getting checked soon. on my mother's side, its more of the female reproductive system that suffers, so i have it coming from both sides.  however, cancer is unpredictable, and can happen just as randomly as anything else.  lesson here: if you see a weird mole, have blood in your stool or urine, you haven't gone number two in days, you're female and your periods are hell on earth or non-existent, or you have severe migraines and double vision, get checked. don't be afraid, don't put it off, and please don't get embarrassed. doctors poke lots of people up the butt.
t3_1sesd6-t1_cdx9664-cdy43jb	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i just flat out told them, "she's going to flip her car on the way home from her girlfriends. not now but give it a couple weeks. whatever you do [to my sister] drive like an old lady." she usually has a lead foot, from then on, she dropped her speed. good thing, too. she would have died.  other instances are similar. but not as tragic. when i was in my teens, my arm started hurting whenever i was around a certain friend. i told my sisters about it but they didn't believe me until my friend broke her arm. i think i was 13 at the time. usually a family or friend's death doesn't surprise me. i already feel the sorrow weeks ahead. most recent death, my father in law was diagnosed with colon cancer in late 2005. he told us he had 3-6 months, reality was that he was told 1-4. i knew he was lying but kept that to myself. i also knew that he would be alive to see his grandsons born (one mine, born late 2006), and he would be a happy man when the time came. i helped take care of him. picked him up from his chemo sessions, sometimes took him to doctors appointments. he did go in remission but it all came back with an angry vengeance. i saw it grow by the look of his face. the way he acted. it wasn't normal. i remember the day i picked him up after that check up. it was cold, freezing rain. the look of deviation and the attempt to make jokes. it was a scary, sad, humbling day. i miss him greatly. he lived until 2010, 4 days before my birthday.  the only time i haven't predicted a tragic event was when my brother in law was in a devastating car accident in june of 2005. he had a major brain injury. i don't know how i missed that one. what a good/bad year that was.... oh sister in law got married, i got engaged... that was the good.  because of this random "gift" i'm usually the one to seek when a death strikes. when i get an uneasy feeling, i usually talk to my mom or sisters about it. it's like an empty feeling that can never be filled until fate happens. sometimes i can ignore it if it's nothing life threatening, other times i just cry it out. doesn't go away. the empty feeling happens when my mom gets bad news. like grandpa having a heart attack. i called her as soon as the feeling set in. i know when she's keeping something from us. it's weird. she doesn't like it when i prod at her to spill the beans.   so ya. those are the things i clearly remember.   edit: wow this is long... tl/dr: i get bad feelings when bad things are going to happen about 2 weeks prior, i have soon-to-be-real dreams up to 2 years in advance, usually good things.

t3_2pdls3-t3_2pdls3-cmw18zn	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i am a hypochondriac. i have been dying of at least fifty different kinds of cancers for most of my life.  at age thirteen, i had a bout with haemorrhoids. i was stalwartly convinced i had colon cancer and would die, that was until i didn't months later. this would probably be the first major health-related panic attack i had.  the same time, i entered puberty and had a few changes you'd expect. i noticed my penile shaft for the first time; i thought i was suffering from peyronie's disease, or a hernia pushing the urethera out. later i suspected i had penile cancer, and that i was to die shortly once again. my fears were later vaporised when i watched porn for the first time and noticed identical features on the male model.  at age fifteen, the abraham cherrix story was on tv, and they mentioned lymphoma. i felt the side of my neck; big mistake. there was a lump there. for three years until my next physical, i was convinced i had lymphoma. i googled lymphoma cures. i told everyone at school i had lymphoma and was going to die, which led to severe bullying. my fears this time were assuaged after the doctor told me the lump in question was simply "shotty" and was not a tumour after all.  in 2007, i had slightly abnormal blood test results. *oh fuck*, it was finally happening. i had cancer for sure. now i had numeric proof; abnormal blood test results. for almost a year, i had once again told everyone i had cancer. this time it was colon cancer once again; my iron levels were below normal. to my great relief once again, this was revealed to be mere thalassemia trait, and i was not in fact bleeding internally from undiagnosed colon cancer.  in 2008, i needed an eye exam. after noticing some white in my iris in a prom picture, i knew i had retinoblastoma. the terror leading up to my eye exam was intense, as that fateful day would surely be the day i learned i was going to die. the eye doctor didn't find retinoblastoma, but did educate me on how it was only found in children.  the most serious was when i was about to graduate high school. after a few episodes in january 2009 of me "jerking awake" mid-sleep, i came to the immediate, irrational conclusion that i had been suffering from a sleep-interrupting brain tumour. what immediately ensued was a period of dizziness and thinking i was losing my balance constantly. after a few google searches, i was led to the "diagnosis" of a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, a deadly brainstem tumour that causes similar symptoms. mind you, this is a super-rare tumour that 300 *ten year olds* get per year. it wasn't even in my age range. that wasn't enough to assuage my fears; until august, when i finally got the courage to see the doctor, i had spent every waking moment googling brain cancer cures and information about brain tumours. when i say every moment, i mean *every moment*. all non-school, non-job time was spent parked in front of a computer, googling cancer. this added up to about 12 hours of my day just reading about cancer. i didn't want to sleep in my bed either for some reason; much to the consternation of my parents, i spent 6 months sleeping on the living room floor, couch, and outside on the hammock. all the while, i bemoaned the "fact" that i was dying, suffered intense dizzy spells, headaches. i was fully convinced this was finally it. when i went to the doctor this time, he ruled out a tumour with a five-minute test called a fundoscopy, where he checked for swelling in the back of the eye. almost instantaneously, the dizziness stopped, and i walked out of the doctor's office that hour feeling the best i had felt in six months, elated that i would live to see another day.  it didn't end there. in 2010, i had my first kiss with another guy. instead of enjoying it, i returned to my car to spit it out into an empty pepsi can repeatedly. after all, he had to have had aids, and i was going to get it through kissing. for months i knew i had aids. it was inescapable. the worst part of all, i couldn't tell my parents because of how i got it. i paid out of pocket for an expensive aids test nobody else to this day knows i got; the results were negative. compounding the issue, the nurse at the lab told me i wasted my money when she learned i was a virgin and had only kissed another man. not only that, but she berated me for being "80s homophobic", which didn't help things.  in 2011, i had haemorrhoids once again. this time for three months. you guessed it; colon cancer. was the doctor in 07 wrong? did i have it after all, and did it finally catch up? well, they let up after 6 months, and so did the thought of cancer. during this time, my grades at school slid tremendously, as all i could think about was colon cancer.  in late 2013, i woke up one morning unable to hear out of my left ear. this was an acoustic neuroma, of the rare cancerous type. again, i was fully convinced i was dying. i sought help from the acoustic neuroma association, and even talked to people who referred me to the house ear instituite, who i was ready to call with the news that i had an acoustic neuroma (despite never even seeing my pcp). i decided to go to my gp first though, and scheduled an appointment. the morning of my gp appointment, before even going, my ear had unblocked itself for the first time in a month and i could hear again. the gp diagnosed me with eustacian tube dysfunction and sent me on my way, once again cancer-free. at the time i was job-searching, and had even put my search on hold for an entire month while i spent *every moment* once again googling brain cancer cures.  the ride will never end. for the rest of my life, i will be dying of something. this contributes to a fear of doctors i have. i don't even get physicals or tests anymore because, why do i even want to know if i'm dying of something? what good will it do? they can't cure it, and i can't live with the thought of knowing i'm dying. i've done it tens of times before. i'll never be okay with having a terminal illness. whenever that day comes, it will hit me like a freight train, and ruin every last minute of what i have left as i lay in bed, miserable.   i think the one positive thing i can take away from this is, i've been through "dying" enough to know of the true fragility of life.

(that was just blood test iirc).  cue one year after chemo, and he has colon cancer that is now showing up potentially in his lungs, but tests negative for cancer still.  they went to do surgery and had to remove half of his right lung, and noted it had likely spread elsewhere.  it was only when they confirmed bone and brain cancer, he finally tested positive somehow...   not sure if it was just his type of colon cancer, but i certainly have my doubts about the efficacy of some of the tests.  as his son i will have to endure a few tests in my lifetime, but a small price to pay vs. getting cancer.  my wife is going through chemo right now... and it is not something you want to go through.

t3_3qe5uw-t1_cwf4f60-cwfj09p	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	cancerous cells happen every day in everyone's bodies. it's just a fact of life. dna gets damaged, and that causes the cell to replicate improperly. your t cells find those mutated cells, and destroy them. where it becomes a problem is when your immune system does not recognize the mutations, and does not destroy the cells in time. that is why it becomes more and more likely to get cancer as you age. your body's immune system gets slow, and gets overwhelmed. also, the more time that goes on, the more chances there are for dna damage, along with more epigenetic gene mutations. it's also why people with aids often die of cancer in the end. the immune system is the key to keeping cancer at bay.  obviously growth factors can increase the growth of certain cells in the body. if one of those cells becomes cancerous, and expresses the receptor for that growth factor, then increases in that factor can speed up the spread of that particular cancer. your immune system is still the gatekeeper in this whole game. a healthy and functioning immune system should be capable of taking those cells out in time. if you do not have a healthy and functioning immune system, or have some genetic predisposition to a certain cancer, then taking compounds that increase growth factors can increase the likelihood that a cancer will spread faster if it gets out of hand. they are not going to cause cancer, though. human growth hormone and igf-1 levels are highest in adolescence. however, most young people have immune systems that are just as strong. so cancer is not a problem. there are cases where a genetic predisposition, or an epigenetic change from an outside factor, can tip the scales in cancer's favor. in those instances, taking supplements that increase certain growth factors is probably not a good idea. if i found out i had brain cancer, i probably would reevaluate taking certain things that increase bdnf and ngf. however, i am not going to lose sleep over it under normal circumstances.

t3_9t4ah-t3_9t4ah-c0ebgc9	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	it's hard to discuss this issue without getting labeled as a "conservative" or "liberal". people like to assume that there are only 2 sides that you can choose from. i have been following the debate over healthcare and am not opposed to a 'public option' nor am i in favor of 'mandatory insurance'. my concern is that insurance companies are a bunch of big, greedy, self-serving assholes. if you force them to do things like: cover people with terminal diseases or deny them the ability to drop someone's coverage you basically end up creating bigger problems. sure, they'll insure you....they'll just jack your rates up 400% to cover the cost.   on the other end of the scale you run into the problems created by the 'uninsureable'. these are all the people with terminal brain cancer, emphysema (caused by a lifetime of smoking), or liver failure (caused by a lifetime of drinking). all of these worst-case-scenarios will end up on the public option because no insurance company will want to touch them with a 10 ft. pole.   so, you end up with a situation where the worst cases are on government sponsored plans getting sub-standard care. (just ask some veterans about va hospitals or look at medicare). on the other end of the of the spectrum you got healthy people with employer-sponsored insurance who's rates went up to cover the inevitable end-of-life period which will cost the insurance company millions. it seems the only two options thus far are: increased insurance rates or sub-standard healthcare administered by a bureaucracy. there have to be some better choices than this. :/  my personal feeling about this is: "why is it so bad to die?" i believe in euthanasia. if i have some terminal brain cancer that is very painful and fatal then i don't want to stick around. i would say goodbye to all my friends and family and then kill myself in a dignified way.  our system is all about prolonging life at any cost. but, in the end, we all die anyway. i don't know what the answer is. but, i do think that we haven't thought through the all of options in much detail. they sound good on paper but, in real life it will become quite messy. there are a lot of gray areas. it took us decades to create this mess. we won't figure it out in 8 months.

t3_qp0qk-t1_c3zkqsg-c3zl46g	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	my daughter and her husband moved here to be closer to my wife and me.  i too would gladly leave this state, but i have a good job and because i have brain cancer i need to be near md anderson.  (i live about 3.5 hours away.)  yes there are other top notch clinics in the country, and we might consider moving later, but again, there's the job issue and the fact that my daughter recently moved and our other two children still live here.    and there are other things that keep us here.  great food.  various forms of culture (high culture, local folk culture, ethnic/racial cultures, vibrant music scene) and our extended families.    unfortunately, the incredibly backwards, redneck, intentional stupidity (occurs when people favor ideology and hate over facts and thought) that allows for perry and his cronies to stay in office makes me sick to my stomach.  this is not an opinion based simply on ideology.  it is driven by the realities that we have such poor funding for education, we love the death sentence, we love to hate (gays, minorities, the poor, anyone who is not both a conservative and a "christian").    bottom line: while there are many terrible things about living here, there are enough wonderful things to balance that all out in terms of daily life.  besides, the demographics are changing (which also accounts for a lot of the current hysteria) and ideally, in about 20-40 years, we may once again become a democratic state...a liberal one this time.  (we've been a one-party state since reconstruction.  but for over 100 years it was a conservative democratic state.  since the 1980s, we moved to becoming a one-party republican state because it has come to better represent the fox news, glenn beck, rush limbaugh "philosophies.")

t3_22x4xt-t3_22x4xt-cgrdayk	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.759	this may be as unpopular as the puffin, but i sort of agree.  not in all cases, such as the mental health issues (anxiety, depression, and others) because those can be regulated with diligence, medication and support even if it takes a long time to find what works for you.    i'm 27, and my neurologist and i are trying to figure out if i have brain cancer.  the results have thus far been inconclusive, but there is a shadow on my cat scan that, and i quote, "worries them" because it's coupled with brain crippling migraines that cause me to go blind, sound sensitive, smell sensitive, and traditional medications don't work long enough for me to get better.  if it turns out that i am royally screwed and end up with a tumor - i'm trying to be cavalier here, i'm really not as okay with this as i sound - my boyfriend of 4 years and i have discussed where to go from here.  though obviously nothing is concrete, we decided that it would be best if we broke up.  clearly this isn't a marriage, so the only lives we'll be ruining are our own, but if this is a tumor, and if it is inoperable, i would be loathe to force someone to stay by my side through the sort of trials and tribulations that come with chemotherapy.  neither would i want to shackle him to a relationship that is doomed to fail.    i don't want this to seem like we don't care about each other.  we do.  we've discussed marriage, we've discussed children and even named them for when they happen.  i am deliriously happy with this man.  i love him more than i have words in any language to speak.  but if i am sick, if i am dying, then he should go before things get any worse - and any deeper - than they already have.  it breaks my heart.

"i have a large bald spot on my head where the radiation therapy permanently killed my hair. i can  no longer drive  because the cancer interferes with signals from my eyes travelling to where they need to be processed. in short, i am not at all what she married. the cancer will kill me and she should not have to waste time caring for me when she could be with someone healthy. this thinking won't help me, so i just do as much as i can for her every day, as limited as it may be. i understand your anger over your spouse leaving, but there are great aspects over knowing someone you love can be happy with someone healthy. *edited repeatedly for spelling

t3_1on2ad-t1_cctl2q7-cctmfis	brain_cancer	relevant	0.6096	i know exactly how you feel. my mom was the healthiest person i knew. she was always concerned about nutrition and exercised every day. then one day, she told us she was depressed. she was put on anti depressants, which made her very loopy (or so we thought). after a couple of weeks, her mood was better, but she was getting more and more confused. i wasn't living at home with my parents, so i only saw her on weekends. when i saw her like this, i told my dad to stop giving her the medication and he did. i slept at my parents house that night. the next morning, my mom was more confused than i had ever seen her (or anyone, ever). i started asking her questions like "did you eat breakfast?" she couldn't answer them. at lunch time, i asked her why she wasn't making herself lunch when she was hungry. she didn't know. my dad made her lunch and we took her to the er. a cat scan found a huge brain tumor taking up most of her frontal lobe. an mri found a second. she had brain surgery two days later to remove the larger tumor. she survived it, but never came back. her personality, most of her memories, most of her ability to think, were all gone forever. one week later, another mri was done. the larger tumor had already started to grow back. two weeks later, she was dead. she went from sane and healthy to dead in 6 weeks at age 54. sorry that was really long. if you want to talk to a stranger who has gone through something similar, i'm here. good luck.

t3_1cgey5-t1_c9g97wq-c9ggle6	brain_cancer	relevant	0.7541	my cousin had a tumor on her brain stem.  when they removed it, the nerves (or whatever the technical term is) that send the signal that your stomach is sated were injured.  she was incredibly skinny and fit before the surgery, but rapidly gained weight afterwards because she had no awareness whether she was full or not.  had to seriously adjust her diet and ignore her constant hunger cravings to get back to normal weight.  she still feels hungry all of the time.

t3_2xjus3-t3_2xjus3-cp0woog	brain_cancer	relevant	0.5263	practice your responses to things you know will come up.  determine what your boundaries are and how you will enforce them, and practice those.  if going to their house is a trigger, don't go- meet them in neutral territory. we make my nlaws come to our house most often, because their house is a depressing place to be, and they are both very comfortable being hostile and acting like assholes in their house. they behave better in ours.  we always try to invite my husband's uncle along to family gatherings too, because most importantly, we love him- he is a nice person and one more person they will unconsciously behave better around. my husband's son (an adult) is also a good person to invite, because they try a little harder when he is there too. he's actually a secret ninja too, because as long as i have known him, i have never once seen him take any of the bait the ns dangled before him. he met them when he was 14 (because they'd caused his mother to flee with him when he was a baby with their hostile n shit that had to have been far worse when they were younger and not physically ill.) i watched that kid adeptly deflect my nmil's invasive questioning and "oh poor me" shit. seriously, he's a legend in this house.  you can say tings like "we need to change the subject now, mom, because that is just too painful." and there can be a consequence if she won't relent- you can say "you know, mom, i asked you to change the subject with me, but since you're stuck on this, i'm going to go now. i'll see you later."   you can set limits on things like phone calls and their duration. "well, i'm glad you're doing alright, mom. that's good to hear. i need to go now, and i'll talk to you next week." or "i'm sorry that happened, and i hope you feel better soon. i'll talk to you again next week."  it's hard, but we do it. nmil has been fighting stage 4 lung cancer that did spread to her spine and brain. treatment is amazing these days, and she's going to get some cancer-free years out of it. she's made it an emotional bullshit struggle at every stage- harping on some thing about how we all have to decide if she gets the treatment or not, and going through a repeat of that at every stage of treatment. we're now on the last bit where all she has to do is get radiation therapy to knock out what is in her brain. her prognosis is very good and she should be celebrating that and looking forward to say 5 years of good life. instead, she's going around telling everyone she encounters "i have brain cancer." there's no changing this sad sack personality. she will spend the rest of her life telling people what they should feel sorry for her about. she taught us one thing- life is too short and we're not playing that head game. it's not at all cruel that i ignore her "i have brain cancer" statements and ask her if she wants more mashed potatoes. she is the cruel one. she wants her whole family to sit around with long faces and cry and wail and weep for the rest of her life. she wants many unreasonable things. we can't give them to her.
t3_42i1u2-t1_czalvua-czb2vs3	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i had a boss that faked brain cancer to get attention from a girl/coworker whose grandmother had just died of cancer. i was hired after the whole thing had started, but it was the "office secret" kind of. he had told her one night and told her not to tell anybody. of course she did.  so, he was getting a lot of questions about chemo, surgery, etc. he eventually took four or five days off and said he was having surgery. he came back to work with his head shaved and a cut along the side of his scalp. it was obvious that it wasn't nearly deep enough to be a surgical scar and that's when everybody figured out he was lying. he immediately quit and moved half way across the country and that's the last any of us heard from him.

t3_3l5l0o-t3_3l5l0o-cv3oj02	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	not really an everyday technology, but a cure for cancer would be nice. i was diagnosed with brain cancer at 19 (i'm 21 now), and, although i'm doing really well for the type of cancer and stage it was in, there is always a possibility it comes back. and when cancer comes back, the treatment isn't the same as the first time. the first time, i received more than a lifetime's worth of radiation to my brain, so they can't even do radiation again (which wasn't too bad compared to chemotherapy). instead, they can only give me chemo if it comes back, which was the worst experience of my life for a year straight.   so if they could come out with a cancer vaccine or treatment that would make it so i never have to worry about it again, i feel like i could finally get on with my life and put all that far behind me.

t3_3t03ve-t3_3t03ve-cx3h2lh	brain_cancer	relevant	0.5867	but wait, there's more!  smoking is great and my number one way of self-medicating with my cannabis. but! i liked smoking it before i knew i had brain cancer, so i didn't find adapting to the short term high/smoking process at all difficult.  for those who haven't smoked and aren't certain about it/don't like inhaling smoke there are tons of options!  the first to look at for nausea is the vaporizer. i personally recommend the volcano for at home, and the pax for portable. set to a cool but effective temperature they can give you the positive feelings you are looking for without coughing. they also let you monitor how much pretty easily and control how "high" you will get.  another method, imo the most effective, is edibles and tinctures. there are many ways to address this, herb based vs oil based, food vs tincture/capsule, strain/phenotypes included, etc. the options keep going. for people on chemo, probably the best (the one best for me when i was on) was a high quality tincture. a small amount put in your mouth under the tongue gives a real nice relaxing body buzz.  that's the big difference of eating vs smoking. much more body buzz with eating, which definitely helps with sleeping and nausea.  a real point too... be careful where you get your cannabis! some, most, is clean delicious medicinal herb. it's possible though to grow it dirty, leave pesticides etc in, or treat/spray it for marketing. it's not common and hopefully you shouldn't have to worry about it, but the more you know about what strain you've got, where it was grown, and how it was grown the better.   hopefully there is a compassion club around for most members facing cancer in their community. for canadians who don't know/trust their local supply there are lots of great online dispensaries. some require full government prescription, others are more bc liberal and can work with just diagnosis. you can get some of the best bud in the country at your door incognito.  and let's all hope for legalization/medical insurance coverage before too long!!!
t3_2h50uk-t1_ckplxxq-ckpvzm6	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	as someone who actually had a bout of hypochondria, it is -not- fun. it actually affected my marriage for the time it was going on because my wife had a hard time dealing with my constant state of panic.   you know when you read on webmd that your cough is "probably just a cough or lung cancer!!!" and you're like "uh...yeah, it's just the regular cough"?  when you've got the hypochondria going on, when you have a pain your brain just won't dismiss the bad things. i had a headache and for the next two days i was worried i had brain cancer, or that i may die any moment from an aneurysm. i had back pain and thought i probably had cancer in my lymph nodes there. my hand hurt and i thought somehow i'd developed rheumatoid arthritis.   it was a really miserable time. i have no idea exactly why it stopped, but i just woke up one day feeling better and i was able to push the negative thoughts out of my head. i recognize a lot of people don't have that sudden change back to positive, but i'm glad i did.
t3_t3hyv-t3_t3hyv-c4jcnq1	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.5151	growing up, i was a slight hypochondriac. never unreasonably, but i was imaginative. more often than anything, i considered the curiosity that i had a brain tumor. i would wonder if a person would know they had one, what it might cause, and how it could just be there without anyone knowing.   well last year i had a seizure. turns out i had brain cancer. a golfball sized tumor in the occipital region with dendrils that extended to the spinal column. so basically i was right. it was there, doing nothing. doctors said they couldn't be sure how long it was there, but they estimated between 5 and 15 years.

t3_433dvn-t1_czf6nuz-czfbnak	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	&gt; yup, i know mine did. at age 13-15 i was interested in girls both romantically and sexually, without at all being interested in guys. in fact, i've never felt more strongly about a person than i did with my first major crush (a female). around about age 16, i sort of just started noticing guys more and became less interested in girls. i'd say at around 18, i couldn't at all think about girls in a sexual or romantic way. now (at 20) vaginas make me shudder, so i identify as gay.   stuff started at 16 for me too, only it wasn't at all gradual and hit me like a damn truck pretty much overnight. different outcome though, i pretty much stabilized into an equal sexual interest in men and women (though my attractions are very gender specific, i'm about the furthest from pan someone could get) and that's remained pretty much the same since i got it figured out.  on one hand, it was more analogous to getting used to an addition than moving into a new house, which would almost certainly have been more stressful. on the *other* hand it would have been nice to have been able to gradually get used to it, i seriously thought i had brain cancer or something at first.

t3_4qxanv-t3_4qxanv-d4x00ge	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.743	i developed a brain abscess during my last quarter of college. a week after my commencement ceremony, i came down with what were originally diagnosed as cluster headaches that lasted a bit more than a week. one particular morning, i woke up in incredible pain and very dizzy. i walked over to the toilet and threw up. my girlfriend and brother took me to the hospital where the doctor originally told us it was highly likely i had brain cancer and not to expect a good outcome. the last thing i remember is sitting in an er gurney with my mom and a family friend. i woke up in the icu with a 24 cm surgical incision on my scalp. the doctor told me it was a brain abscess and not a tumor and that i would be fine.
t3_2ps4bp-t1_cmzj2do-cmzneab	brain_cancer	relevant	0.6808	wow, this is almost identical to what happened to me. my mom had a brain tumor that they found when she slipped and hit her head at work. she immediately went into surgery and fell into coma after. even when she woke up, she was blind (but constantly hallucinating the world around her), couldn't remember where she was, how old i was or why she was in a hospital.  i can definitely relate to those feelings you described though. i always felt this combination of guilt from being glad when she died and her suffering ended, and relief knowing that my family could move on and try to live a normal life without her.       im sorry you had to go through that, but i'm glad you're doing better now!

t3_7sbjm-t3_7sbjm-c07aap6	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	my aunt had a very similar case.  the doctors cut her scalp ear-to-ear, peeled her forehead down over her face and the back of her scalp down around the base of her skull, and then essentially cut the top of her skull off as if it were a cap.  they pulled her brain back (i think i remember them saying) about 1.5-2 inches out of her skull and then began to bore out the tumor from her eye socket, which they later reinforced with some sort of mesh and bone fragments from cadavers.  as well, the tumor was apparently wrapped around her ocular nerve, so they risked severe damage when they removed that.  my mom saw her the next day in the hospital and said she had never seen someone so swollen. "her eyes were sunk into her face a good 2-3 inches... like someone had punched holes in her skull where her eyes should've been."  honestly, one of the craziest surgeries i've ever heard of, but she survived and seems to be alright now.

t3_460rrq-t1_d01vorr-d020cxc	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6673	this was basically 100% my mom's story. she was an alcoholic and heavy drug user from 11-a few months before she died. she got lung cancer and amazingly it was treatable and she didn't have to have chemo or radiation! but even after that she continued to drink and abuse drugs and smoke. her scans kept coming back normal and her cancer in remission. then she started acting very odd. she would have black outs, several hit and runs with her truck, even falling down randomly(once into a bon fire). we as her family thought she was just using more, and in grief from her husband dying 6 months prior. the final incident was she crashed her car three times in 10 minutes. hit a pole, drove off and ran some one over, then totaled her truck slamming into a stop light pole. after a brain scan they discovered a rumor that was taking up 30% of her brain. once again she was treatable. but she was sober and clean while in the hospital. possibly the longest run of sobriety in her entire life. it was amazing and the doctors were amazing! they removed the large tumor and a smaller one in her prefrontal lobe. other than a seizure she recovered and got stronger. they released her eventually and she went to live with my sister. everything was fine. memorial day weekend she went to a cook out and asked my sister to take her home, she wasn't feeling well. the next day my sister went to check on her and she was in distress. my sister called 911 and then called me. from the time she called to the time i got to the hospital (roughly 20 minutes) she was fully on life support. we took her off ls after a few hours and held while she died. moral of the story: a life of abusing your body will catch up to you. you can dodge several medical bullets but eventually your body gives out. they said that her organs just failed. they were so damaged from her life style that even though her tumors were operable her body wasn't healthy enough to sustain life. i urge every person to not smoke and drink and use drugs. cancer is hard enough to beat when you're other wise "healthy" sorry for the book i wrote but i feel very strongly about this subject as it hits very close to home.
t3_fibs5-t3_fibs5-c1gqjol	brain_cancer	relevant	0.5008	thanks everyone for all of your suggestions. i did get her an ipod when she was first diagnosed, so i'll download some books on tape for her to listen to.  an update - she just spent four days in the hospital - her most recent mri showed a tumor on her spine and another on her brain lining (which at least explains why she was having so much weakness and trouble walking) and a fractured vertebra. they've taken her off the oral meds she was on (since they obviously weren't working) and her appetite is slowly returning. i was able to visit and take her some treats on saturday and keep her company for a while.  she is undergoing a course of radiation to try to shrink the tumor on her spine. if that doesn't work, she will probably have to move into hospice.
t3_2n8opw-t3_2n8opw-cmbeeds	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	this could be a long post...(sorry in advance for mistakes using mobile) my grandma recently passed away in august. she passed from brain cancer.  she was born in thunder bay ont. can. her maiden name was ardelle munn. her original goal in life was to be a nun. that changed when she saw my grandpa, rolling up in his red ford galaxy 5000 convertible. they fell in love and had my dad. then, they moved to a small town called uranium city. they had one more child there. my grandma was a stay at home mom and my grandpa was a miner. after a few years, they moved to edson alb. can. where my grandma started a foster home. including foster children, she had 97 kids go in and out of that house. all but 3 have been successfull and have high paying jobs. every thanksgiving, christmas, easter and other holidays, she would find a family with no home/food and make them supper and let them stay over the night. she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007. she was deemed cancer free in 2010. then, last july, she was diagnosed with a terminal brain cancer. no matter what the doctors told her, she always had a smile on her face. she would joke with the doctors and they said she was their favorite they had in a long time. she had that effect on people. in late july, things took a turn for the worst. she started to lose memory, and hallucinate. she would scream at night, because there were spiders in her bed and blindfolders. the doctors said that they can take her off medication and she could live 7 weeks, or leave her on it and and have 5 months. we left it on, and the next day she passed. her favorite thing was a butterfly. we caught some before the funeral, and let them go as they lowered the casket. at the time of her death, she had one child left in her care, my cousin, her last foster child. she defined a perfect woman. she had no flaws and was awesome. i love you grandma how i coped: i stayed with my family for awhile, and i was with my grandpa alot too. i found it easiest around them. tl;dr my grandma died of cancer. she should be a saint edit: grammatical issues

t3_3klnqm-t3_3klnqm-cv31zle	brain_cancer	relevant	0.7982	somewhat related - not exactly in response to what people say to him about his diagnosis but more so about his appearance.   my boyfriend is young and has brain cancer, in turn the long-time corticosteroids have bloated his face a decent amount and he also has a lot less hair than pre-diagnosis. he had someone checking his id at a hotel's happy hour who told him straight to his face "that doesn't look like you." he is never comfortable playing the cancer "card" but needless to say he immediately said to her "i have brain cancer." i don't think i've ever seen someone look like they pooped their pants harder than that lady.   that was only one of multiple times this has happened - once mid radiation when his hair was falling out on the right side (you can't buzz down your head until after because the mask needs to fit exactly) someone at a froyo place asked him if his hair was "a new fashion thing." another guy stared at his scars on his head for a good few mins and then felt the need to ask "what happened to you?" while standing in line at an ice cream place. it's amazing how many people don't think before they speak.

t3_4lg2lm-t1_d3ngtcc-d3ni2ka	brain_cancer	relevant	0.8075	my grandmother fought cancer for ten years, it went into remission and she was (or thought she was) in the clear for twenty years. suddenly, in her late forties, she started having memory problems. at first, she tried to hide it, but when she started having trouble remembering things like her daughter's name or what year it was, she finally went to the doctor and pushed for further screening. her brain was *riddled* with tumors. they gave her a couple months, at best. they went thousands and thousands of dollars into debt putting her through chemo. she didn't qualify for medical insurance because she'd first had cancer in her early twenties. preexisting condition, they said. after a few months of fighting, she just gave up. stopped treatment and told her husband and children she'd either die or she wouldn't, but she was done. she lasted another eighteen months after that. at the end, she thought she was a little girl. didn't know where she was, who her husband or children were, or why she was always hurting. she thought she was being held captive and they were hurting her. my grandfather once drunkenly admitted that he felt relieved when she finally passed and that the guilt never left him for that.   my mother likes to pretend she was unaffected, but it definitely influenced her treatment of me growing up. i guess i'm a lot like my grandmother. when i had my own cancer scare at the age of twenty, she put aside all her emotional bullshit and drove 600 miles to help me fight my insurance to get things taken care of. only time she's ever come through for me on anything.

t3_4qeh7p-t1_d4sfwxz-d4tnuog	brain_cancer	relevant	0.8375	i had a friend who had brain cancer and surgery, they removed a section of skull and brain tissue under it. she wore a hat from the time of her surgery until they put a protective plate back for the missing skull section. imagine a big scoop out of one side of her head, skin sill over it, scar, but nothing round under it to make it look normal. she wore the hat for warmth, a little padding (no bone under it), so she felt she looked 'normal', and so other people weren't freaked out.   according to this rule (and your post), she was being rude. according to real understanding, she was being polite. i think a lot of etiquette rules are not only stupid, but are signs of people jumping to conclusions too fast, like wearing a hat only having one possible meaning, you must want to leave! rather than wearing a hat to keep warm, to look good (cancer patient and hair loss!), to feel self respect (my friend), for religious reasons, or a host of others.

t3_n72ir-t3_n72ir-c36szlc	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	wow, this reminds me a lot of something that happened to me a few years ago.  i worked at starbucks, and i mainly worked nights, and the night crowds are usually either regulars or young people, and for a little while, this grouchy-as hell guy kept coming around.  every few nights he'd come in, bark his order at us, and not talk at all, he'd just glare at us while he waited for his drink and then he'd leave.  one night i was on register, and i see him, and while i knew he'd pretty much just be a dick, i figured, "why not have some fun with him?" so i tried to be especially friendly to the guy. as he approaches i give him a big smile and say, "so how are you doing tonight?"  "terrible! worse than last night, and i'll probably be worse tomorrow."  not the answer i was expecting, i didn't know how to respond at first, but eventually i said, "well it can't be that bad can it?"  "yes. it can."  "well what's wrong?"  "i'll tell you what's wrong. my wife and i own a farm. it's our livelihood.  we have to take care of it every day and we never get a day off, or else we won't be able to live. that's our life and we chose it. my wife got brain cancer last year, and since then she has been in and out of hospitals, and finally i got her back home and so i spend all of the time that i'm not working on the farm taking care of her, and whatever free time i have i spend researching surgery and brain cancer and caner in general because doctors are all fucking incompetant and don't know what the fuck they are doing. one doctor, i have had **one** good doctor, and all the rest are just assholes who are there for a paycheck, and she may as well already be dead to them. they don't care. they want to do surgeries and biopsies, but most research shows that biopsies in the brain have a high risk of spreading cancerous tissue, so i have been fighting them almost every goddamned time they make another stupid decision about how to treat her. i had to hire her brother to work for us on the farm because i don't have the time to do it all on my own and most days he flakes out and never shows up. i get about 3 hours of sleep a day, every day, and there will never be a day that i get more sleep than that until my wife has died, or been made well. nothing is going to get better on its own unless i do it myself, and nothing is going to just go away. i probably can't even do this all, i will probably lose her and eventually lose the farm, but in the mean time, i will keep losing sleep and working as hard as i can to keep it all together."  that's more or less what he said verbatim, but we talked to him for over an hour, so there was a lot more said than i was able to include. he continued to come in, and he continued to be generally not too pleasant, but he was markedly nicer than he had been, and we definitely didn't hold his demeanor against him after what we'd learned.
t3_1lncty-t1_cc1oi3v-cc1pfpf	brain_cancer	relevant	0.7449	it's a terrible disease. i had a friend who died of brain cancer a few years back and my aunt is diagnosed with stage 4 cancer that spread from the stomach to the pancreas, lungs and liver. so i'm not disagreeing that it's a terrible disease that i personally would like to see cured for my family's sake.  that doesn't change the fact that cancer is responsible for 15 % of all human deaths every year. in the short term, curing cancer would be great. but curing cancer, heart disease, aids, diabetes and all the other terrible sicknesses would only speed up what will be one of the biggest problems for mankind in the next 100 years.   i don't like saying it, but if you look at it objectively, curing cancer doesn't exactly help mankind.  oh, and i'm sorry for your loss. i do know what cancer does to a person and i'm not saying that i would want anyone to die of cancer because i don't. i'm merely pointing out that i wouldn't want my grandchildren being raised in a world where dying of cancer wouldn't be the worst thing to happen to a person.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_overpopulation - read about it there.

t3_qs08j-t3_qs08j-c404bw9	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6112	when i was 22-ish the same thing happened to me. i lost the clarity i used to have and seemed to be lost in anxiety inducing fog. i convinced myself i had brain cancer and went and get a mri. of course it came up clean.  i am 34 now and i cant say i have regained all the clairevoyance i had in my youth but i can tell you the biggest contributing factor to my fogginess is diet.  by the time i was 23-24 i suffered from chronic constipation. going only once a week became the norm. it's taken me a long time to tweak my diet and figure out what works and what doesnt. basically, what i follow is this: lots of vegetables, meat is good but red meat only in small doses, refined flour products=bad, whole grains=good, sugar and dairy are only once in a while treats. good luck my friend...

t3_1rwvz3-t3_1rwvz3-cdrt7m7	brain_cancer	relevant	0.6469	even though she didn't survive, i still feel as though people should be made aware of the dismissive nature towards elderly. my grandmother died of a brain tumour two weeks ago. things started going down hill at around mid february. the first thing that, with hindsight, indicated she had a brain tumor was that she fell. she was out on a coach trip, fell, and had an ambulance called. from this point onwards, everything got worse. some days she wouldn't be able to get out of bed, others she would be fine. some days she would fall and not be able to move her legs, and others she would be wanting to go out. she also complained of dissiness a lot, always saying that it was in her head. her personality changed. she wouldn't strike up conversation whenever we went around to her house, and she swore on occasions (something which i don't think i had ever hear her do in the 17 years i knew her). she also struggled with memory. when she went to the doctors to have a diabetes check, they performed a mental capability test, which she struggled with. she also struggled to write, even though before she would always be doing a word-search. lastly, in the final stages, about a week or two before her death, she tried to eat her food with her hand. she went to the doctors on multiple occasions, and had her legs not moving dismissed because they thought that she wasn't moving enough. they sent her off to have her legs examined and was told that there was nothing wrong with her legs. she never received help for her dissiness about a month before her death. they told us that her memory was failing because she was going deaf, and couldn't hear the question we were asking. on one day, she was exhibiting stroke-like symptoms. she was just sat in the chair being unresponsive, so an ambulance was called for her. the only question which she replied to was how old she was, which she said 79, when she was 78. she never received a brain scan until 5 days before her death. the tumor had swollen up and was pushing, causing the stroke like symptoms, and was sent into a coma-like state until her death. throughout mid february to the end of november, she never received a brain scan until it was too late and pronounced terminal. i feel as though doctors often seem to take the easy root with the elderly and pin the blame on their old age, rather than actually checking

t3_2ztnml-t3_2ztnml-cpmm3q2	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.804	my grandmother raised me for the most part, she was basically my mother. she was diagnosed with terminal lung and brain cancer and given a month to live, she opted for hospice at home care, i cleared things up with my company at the time and made her my only priority.  i spent her last month alive being present and every waking moment possible and caring for her, giving her medicine, preparing her meals, talking her through the grieving process... she apologized she was dying, she would tell me how much she wished she could stay and we really had no option besides raw meaningful honesty in conversation. while this was going on my grandfather died about 12 days before she did.   this whole event was one of my biggest fears because i didn't know how i would handle it, losing her, let alone them.  i would get distraught just at the thought of it when i realized they were getting old and having problems. after everything transpired and i kind of faced not only their death but guiding them down the path to its door, it really shook me. while it was the most tragic event in my life, it was also liberating in the sense that i faced it and came out okay, of not better for it.

t3_dxbxl-t1_c13ndlq-c13nfwl	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	i was diagnosed with brain cancer a few years ago, the tumor was operable, and i obviously survived, but i decided that even though i had an m.d., had been working longer than some of my treating doctors, and maybe went to a better school than most of them, that i would be a patient, just as though i had no medical education. i had to wait sometimes, yes, we book far in advanced, most internists or family docs shouldn't have this long of a wait, but specialists will usually. now, if you don't have insurance and you go to a doctor or hospital for treatment, you pay more than what the insurance company does with the same doctor or hospital, and for the same treatment. this is because the insurance company dictates some procedures or treatments as experimental or contraindicated, but more importantly, they aggressively negotiate compensation. think about it, if one person gets treatment and it is expensive, what is the incentive for the facility to allocate resources and staff to determine how much you should be charged? there isn't much, when compared to the fact that the insurance company is representing thousands of people, and thus if the facility in question didn't participate with that company, they won't ever see the vast majority of those covered by that company walk through their doors. when you pay the bill, you aren't just paying the doctor, but also the bills to keep the lights on, the nursing staff, the accountant, the receptionists, the overhead in medicine is huge. and regarding your brother, no, that behavior is not at all common, many anesthesiologists have anxiety or depression issues of their own, anesthesia is very stressful, so on behalf of the anesthesia providers and all of his patients, i would like to tell your brother: go fuck yourself, and enjoy lowered compensation when your greedy ass fucks up and gets sued for everything you thought it was worth.

t3_3azalt-t3_3azalt-csi7yln	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6553	my mother is just like this, and has been this way (probably) her entire life.   every man she has ever been with since i can remember has abused her in some way or another. her parents beat her and would cover up the bruises. every man has raped her. my aunt, her sister, had cervical cancer, so of course my mom had cancer and brain tumors. she has "keemo" (as she sends in text messages to me) weekly, but most of the time she can't make her appointments because she has to set her schedule around "abusive people" who ruin her life.  i was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in december, and now suddenly she suffers from a debilitating case of it. she has to be on 9 different medications for it (i am on 3), but tells me i should take an antibiotic and i will be cured.  she uses these excuses and lies as a means to justify her perfectly shitty attitude and outlook on life, and as a reason to just shit on every single person who has ever given her the time of day, including her daughter (me.) especially me.   she tries to manipulate people into feeling guilty for her, and immediately lashes out at them the moment they aren't able to adjust her schedule around her / bend to her every single whim.  tl;dr - my mom is a cunt, and people who do this shit are gaping assholes.

t3_3jh7v9-t3_3jh7v9-cup7jni	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	interest in other guys was something which hit me *very* abruptly when i was 16, and at first i thought i had brain cancer or something (among other, less rational suspicions about what was going on with me.) i'm really not kidding, it was so incongruous to anything i'd ever previously felt or thought about that it felt like my own brain was betraying me or that i'd suddenly become possessed, and it hit me almost literally overnight. had i not been raised with the idea that there was nothing wrong with same-sex attraction i probably would have gone stark raving mad.  the rest was extremely anticlimactic. i actually told my folks i wanted to be taken to a doctor, and why. my mother was rather taken aback at first, and my dad's reaction was so deadpan i'm to this day not sure what his feelings were about it at the time. (he's a very uncomplicated man of few words, always has been.) my brother at first thought i was playing some sort of joke on our folks, and wouldn't believe i was bisexual until some time later when i put a guy i was involved with directly in front of him. (it's something he still can't really get his head around, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed.)  all my folks really had to say about it was that i didn't need to see a doctor, and that it would probably be best that i keep it to myself until i went off to college (we lived in a very conservative rural community.) my mom also asked that i *not* tell my maternal grandparents about it, as she felt they wouldn't be able to understand and that it would just cause them unnecessary distress trying to. beyond that, it wasn't something that came up as a subject for discussion much. i had a boyfriend during junior and senior years of high school, who my folks were very nice to and made welcome, though once they found out that he *was* my boyfriend he wasn't allowed to stay overnight anymore. (they're not fools and i'm sure they realized "stuff" was going on, but they didn't want to "officially" condone it any more than they'd have let one of my girlfriends spend the night.)
t3_28vepo-t1_ciev5mz-ciex1sc	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.8063	i didn't have much exposure to my father growing up, but things like your story make me suspect he was an n. he lost his business in a recession and moved away. he stopped paying alimony and child support, i knew this because my mother told me all about it in detail. at that point, she was earning more than him and it was a big thing for her that she was getting one over on him. anyway, a family in the neighbourhood got a home computer, i think a commodore64 (yes, i'm old) and it was soooo cool. i remember talking to my dad about it because we really had nothing to talk about and he just popped out with "would you like me to get you one of those? because i want to get one for you." i didn't know what to say because i knew he had no money, i knew he was barely scraping by and hadn't paid child support for years. so i was extremely wary and deeply uneasy that this was yet another one of his attempts to be the good guy that had always run off the rails and ended in shoddy apologies that could have been avoided if he had just never built up my hopes to begin with. i can't remember what i said in response. but every time we talked after that, he made references to how it was right there in the closet, waiting for us to come down and set it up, so i started to believe him. we hadn't gone down to visit him the previous summer because my nmom had had breast cancer. even though she was "clear", i knew she wasn't full strength so i begged off again that summer because i knew she wouldn't be able to keep up the house by herself. also, at that point, he was essentially a stranger to me because he rarely called or wrote letters or anything. my gcsis went instead. found out later that as soon as she got off the plane he took her to wherever and bought that computer. six weeks went by and on the day before my sister was due to fly home, dad phones because he's got to tell me something. apparently, i was going to have a new sibling in september, he had married his gf in march and she was going to have a baby. now, i can do basic math, it was late august. i was shattered. completely and utterly shattered. i hung up the phone before i started to cry and i just sobbed right there in front of my nmom. she looked at me like i was insane and i barely managed to get out the story in between sobs. she was also blown away (btw, she didn't hug me or tell me it was going to be ok, or anything). i then said "it was just a bribe, that computer" and she looked at me with wonder and dare i even say respect. she then told me that she had wondered why he was doing it and that i was right (she admitted i was right!) after that, i never wanted to speak to him again. what kind of father does that to their own child? that's what casual acquaintances do, family isn't supposed to do that. anyway, years later i thought that maybe i had been too harsh with him, so i got back in contact. turned out to be a big mistake on my part but i least i finally knew that i couldn't deal with his shit, there had never been a relationship to repair. that was one of the things he threw at me to prove he was such a great guy. apparently, i had begged and pleaded with him to buy me that computer, which was a total lie. as for how badly he hurt me with his whole knocking up his gf (who i think actually got pregnant accidentally on purpose to make him propose) and not telling me all i got was "yeah, i could have handled that better" no shit, "father". also, he said to me that he was proud he had never hit his kids (which made me think that his mother must have gone full-on ya-ya sisterhood on him at one point) and i said that that wasn't true. i then told him about the time i remember him spanking me (at night after i had gone to bed, after my mother had spanked me, he was in a rage, pulled my pants down and just whaled on me, i remember screaming and crying and thinking it wasn't fair because i had already been punished) and he was all offended because how dare i spoil his illusions of himself? so he just got drunk and forgot all about it. he was like groundhog day. when he was drunk (which was every night) i could have told him i had incurable brain cancer and once he slept it off would have never remembered it ever happened.
t3_42xkjm-t1_czdymi3-cze1ns6	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	my mom is like your mom. she has brain cancer and the doctors have submitted her into hospice. but before that, she kept wanting to do everything. her quality of life diminished so much but she wanted to keep going with stronger chemo which did nothing to slow the growth of the tumor.  the doctor finally told her that it was too risky for her to continue the chemo and so she stopped. we were relieved but it caused such a strife in our family. my mom wanted to take all the meds to "cure herself" and saw us advising her to go into hospice as "giving up" or "wanting her to die."   we just want her to not puke every time she takes chemo. we just want her to be able to taste food and enjoy the few months she has left. we want her to take a vacation, and accomplish all the wishes and dreams she still has before it's too late.
t3_o6gmo-t3_o6gmo-c3evisf	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	my mom had a geoblastoma brain tumor, grade 4. geoblastomas are very aggressive in any form but a grade 4 is the most aggressive level. after a bit of numbness on her left side she went to the hospital and found the tumor last february. she fought it with surgery, chemo and radiation but a few days before she passed she got sick with pneumonia and that was too much for her system. she passed with me and my sisters there, her mom, brother and friends beside her. she was 53.
t3_3dis0u-t1_ct5kczz-ct5uc37	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6038	i've been df'd for a long time- 20 years, but if i can recall, isn't there a scripture somewhere about talking to god about "the murmurings of the heart"? meaning- if you weren't exactly sure what to pray for. when i was still in, i was diagnosed with brain cancer and epilepsy, had the big c removed, so speech was not my forté at that time. the elders always pushed that point down my throat when i didn't have some sort of medical apparatus in it.
t3_1r5flt-t1_cdjvrhe-cdjvu8q	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	medical costs are hugely inflated (as op notes) so people without insurance almost certainly can't afford long hospital stays or expensive treatment, which is admittedly an awful situation. our insurance legislation also allowed companies to deny people coverage for extremely dubious reasons, which caused a lot of the "i had terminal brain cancer and my insurer dropped me when they found out" stories you see in the news.     at its heart, it stems from the same thing every other circlejerk does: news shows us only the most shocking, heartrending, extreme, or salacious stories. since that's all we see, we assume that's how everything is. healthcare nightmare stories abound, and healthcare success stories are uninteresting. people read the nightmares and extrapolate for all of america.
t3_4d9cl9-t1_d1pc3yp-d1ptmy3	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.5174	yes, it's not the point. but the problem i have encountered as someone who is going through chemotherapy and had to wait to get my flu vaccine, is there are a lot of well meaning people who get really nosey about why you cannot get your flu vaccine.   my employer holds a wellness fair every year and they really push everyone to get their vaccine, and it's free for employees, which is great.  however, if you are not getting it and don't want to disclose the reason, people start getting really nosey and preachy.  there were a few people in my department who got on my case about not getting it. i tried saying "i just have a health reason so i'm waiting" was not a good enough excuse for some. i was actually lectured about why it was important and there are very few reasons why i couldn't get it.   i don't owe anyone an explanation about why i'm not getting it. i also do not want to disclose to anyone at my work that i have brain cancer and i'm going through chemo treatment.
t3_2w1n6k-t3_2w1n6k-comsslq	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	she was texting me while walking down the street one time and commented about how she suddenly felt light headed.    a day later she told me she got freaked out, webmd'd her "symptoms", and legitimately thought she had brain cancer. she was so upset she had her dad call their doctor, who was forced to make a special house visit and perform "brain cancer tests" on her. she did not, surprisingly, have brain cancer.
t3_1kd6yl-t1_cbnug07-cbo3rjn	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.5109	when i had brain cancer i had to have my head shaved. i waited until the day before surgery, and looking back, i wish i had done it sooner so i could have shown off the beautifully shaped head i used to have.   it took me a while after surgery to feel comfortable without a hat on. i never wore wigs, too expensive, itchy and hot. but it was winter, so i had quite the collection of beanies.   i remember the first few times going out in public without a hat on, i was really nervous, felt like everyone was staring at me. but then i realized, i'm bald because i've been through something not many of these people will ever get the chance to understand, live through and overcome. i don't know if that makes me stronger, but i definitely showed off what i had achieved!  hair or not, you're beautiful inside and out.
t3_1uvzc3-t1_cemf6n2-cemo5wt	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i have aspergers/adhd, but i don't think vaccines caused that, just like i don't think that eating a hot dog will give you cancer.  i have family members who have died of brain cancer who lived a lifestyle of total health, and family members who have smoked since the age of 17 who are totally fine.  i am who i am.
t3_2kq6dk-t3_2kq6dk-clo2qsf	brain_cancer	relevant	0.6576	i was diagnosed with brain cancer at age 8. had surgery to remove the tumor, and was giver a 0% chance to see my 13th birthday. i didn't know any of this at the time. but, now i am 33 and doing just fine.
t3_u8ar2-t1_c4t97ta-c4tbewq	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.8005	she was fine after what happened.  she never did remarry though, and i can't blame her.  she actually got brain cancer like my grandpa a few years back and passed away too.  but she did get to see most of her family before she did though.
t3_12wh8l-t3_12wh8l-c6ywvxf	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.5067	ok i actually know what i would call the best looking girl i have ever met... she was diagnosed with brain cancer at 20 and had to re-learn how to talk along with other things... recovery can be tough but now she is normal as ever and healthy.  this is her 8 years later[](http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/420806_10100854084180458_1393751199_n.jpg)
t3_1g1eaw-t1_cafvc5d-cag18gz	brain_cancer	relevant	0.518	i would love to be able to afford a bankruptcy. i found out i had brain cancer right after graduating college. debt collectors dont care if you can't work, they don't care that you just had a quarter of your brain removed, they don't care that you might not get back basic motor skills, that the tremors and seizures will stop. they only care that you give them money. discharging that debt wouldn't give me the upper hand in any sense, it could *maybe* level the playing field and get me out of this deep hole i've been trying to fill for years.   i'm sure you know how it feels to be working poor, having to defer and get forbearance on student loans year after year, interest rates piling up, loan companies constantly on your back. but i'm also fairly certain that the career path you've chose will pay off in the long run. as it stands, i can't go back to the nursing field, not with the motor deficiencies i now have. don't be too jealous.
t3_3fxpcw-t1_ctt2ygd-ctt6f8k	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7681	while still bad, i think that was better than if they had said it was less severe then it was. a family friend's granddaughter, just over a year old at the time, was sick last year. (i think her name is scarlett, too, oddly enough.) doctors said it was nothing, and similar to brad, the parents weren't satisfied with that answer. they took her to another hospital, and within an hour she was undergoing emergency surgery to have a brain tumor removed.
t3_1rpwpk-t1_cdpu0r3-cdpvmba	brain_cancer	relevant	0.7541	my sister just passed last friday due to glioblastoma (brain tumor), she was only 27. she had 6weeks of radio+mild chemo, the was due 6xmonthly chemo but only managed 1.5. i cant help but wish it was me instead, she was the better human being.
t3_3va94z-t3_3va94z-cxnkodc	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	first thing that springs to mind.  round 1 basic  question 1: ”are you a player?”  yup  question 2: ”yeah, i bet you say that to all the girls..”  only the pretty ones  question 3: ”what’s the matter? you look so sad.”  that's because your boring  question 4: how many girls have you slept with?”  too many  question 5: ”are you seeing anyone else?”  yes  intermediate  question 6: ”are you gay?”  honey, i live in a world with [insert celebrity] no-ones that straight.  question 7: ”wow. your friend chad is hot.”  yeah the bro jobs are intense. [retell this story to them untill they believe it](http://x4.fjcdn.com/comments/god+i+love+playing+pranks+_e9bfb30ea17c8a994b3a848630f7cddc.jpg) works best if chad is in on the joke too.  question 8: ”i have a boyfriend.”  so do i  question 9: ”i don’t date little boys/old men”  good, i don't want to date you  question 10: ”sorry, i don’t just give out my number.”  are you saying you make people you meet buy it from you?  advanced  question 11: ”i’m looking for someone who’s not afraid to wait.”  ok. (continue as you were)  question 12: ”…and just so you know, we aren’t having sex.”  not tonight we're not. (continue on as normal)  question 13: ”sorry. i need to get to know you first.”  then ask me an interesting question.  question 14: ”stop, stop. this is moving too fast. let’s take things slow.”  i can't go slow, because i have terminal brain cancer  question 15: ”what kind of girl do you think i am?! i’m not some whore!”  and i'm not some loser that pays for sex.  bonus round  bonus: you’re at the club with an hb9 and leave to use the restroom. when you come back, the hb9 is grinding intensely on the crouch of some guy who's much bigger than you. how do you handle this situation?  "hey do you mind that's my sister"

(i'm not exaggerating, it seriously felt like i'd suddenly become possessed, or my own brain was betraying me.)  my worst fear at the time was that it was actually the case, though i'd have been quite prepared to believe it if someone had suggested i'd been abducted by aliens and had something implanted in my skull.

t3_3nv3rv-t1_cvtf0ep-cvtljup	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i've got add and ocd and i'm just learning mindfulness now that ibgot myself a therapist and the key aspect is that you take your awareness and you tone it down.  my ocd tends to manifest as hypochondria a lot. i'll have a brief headache and then spend 3 days where every waking moment i think i might have brain cancer, sometimes giving myself an anxiety attack over it ( which just adds to the "evidence" that i have cancer). or i'll notice my hand is shaking and think i'm getting parkinson's...even though i just finished a really hard workout and most of me is shaking.  mindfulness is where you make a point to examine and be aware of and acknowledge  the thoughts, but you then basically consciously decide to relabel them as fringe thoughts. like "i think i have cancer because of a headache. it is okay to have this thought, but it was not me that had this thought, it was generated by my brain, a brain programmed to be a little too good at recognizing possible threats. i am the conscious mind, and i know that it is very unlikely that i have brain cancer. headaches are a normal thing people get."

&gt;  &gt; do you have a girlfriend? if so, has she been supportive through all of this? if not, when would you mention this in the course of the relationship?  **[answer](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4takcs?context=1) (waterontheknee):**  &gt; i have a stage iii oligodendroglioma. from what i've read they're very slow growing and not known to be metastatic (spread). when i was diagnosed my doctor told me i had the "best" kind due to its nature. i still laugh about that. i'm a sucker for irony. &gt;  &gt; i did a bunch of research and i found it to be too depressing. i just let my doctor do his thing. i have an mri every 3 months and he tells me what it's doing (so far: nothing. which is good.) &gt;  &gt; my love life was already fairly complicated before all this happened. i was seeing someone for a few months but we broke up about a 6 weeks after this happened (we're still friends though). &gt;  &gt; a week before i was rekindling something with my high school sweetheart (we were on and off for 7 years almost), we had gone out to see the grinch musical (her favorite dr suess character) in december 2010. we were just hanging out and being friends at the time. it seemed like we were going to get back together (as had been our habit/pattern over the time we had known each other).  &gt;  &gt; the day before my seizure i got back together with an ex-girlfriend, we'll call her d.  &gt; d and i dated from july 2009 to may 2010, and we were on and off after she cheated on me in february 2010 (after we had a fight), we stayed together but were constantly fighting most of our relationship anyway. it was toxic to say the least).  during this time i was experience mood swings and was anxious. i want to contribute part of this to the fact that i had brain tumor in my left frontal lobe i didn't know about and i couldn't really compensate for an issue i didn't know anything about. &gt;  &gt; when i woke from my coma i had lost my memory of the previous few weeks, my last really clear memory was january 1st, and i did a polar bear dip on new years day. this particular ex, we had gone out a few times as well before and i was falling in love with her again, wanting to forgive and all that. i woke up and found out she had been contacting my family and friends and i had no idea why. i freaked out and told her to leave me alone.  &gt;  &gt; it took about 4 months for my memory to fully comeback and we had actually gotten back together two days before my seizure. i got back with my on again/off again and that didn't last long before i finally made the decision to break the cycle of breaking up and getting back together, because i honestly didn't see us getting married. we're still really good friends. d and i don't talk anymore.  &gt;  &gt; i've dated a few girls since, and i don't like mentioning it but sometimes the conversation just kind of goes that way "so why did you take 2 years off school instead of just 1?" is a pretty good segway into that. &gt;  &gt; but to be honest, i have no idea how to bring people into this crazy situation. dating was difficult before and it seems like its even harder now. or maybe its the exact same. i don't know. &gt;  &gt; one girl i dated i met while i was actually cycling on temodar while i was out for a friend's birthday, it was getting time for me to take my meds and i had to excuse myself. she asked why and it was pretty awkward. &gt;  &gt; i really shouldn't have been dating anyone while i was going through treatment, to be quite honest.  &gt;  &gt; i've had good reactions to the "i have incurable brain cancer" line, as in they still continue to act like girls and be wishy-washy and play games. i try to avoid girls like that now anyway. focusing more on quality of a person. dating is all about meeting the "right" girl. so it's pretty easy to filter through all the wrong ones. &gt;  &gt; **but** i suppose this is just part of what i'm doing to be a better person. i was a jerk and didn't live to my fullest, now i've been giving the opportunity to be the person i want to be, so that's what i'm doing. i approach things with patience and understanding, and give people enough space to still be themselves. i think my problem has just been meeting people who aren't in a place to settle down and date seriously, while that is the way i approach potential girlfriends. i don't want flings and i want commitment. it's not easy. &gt;   *****  **[question](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4taaxn?context=1) (waydat):**  &gt; i don't have any questions..just wishing you the best. most, in life, are never tested like you've been.. you've been through a lot and you are one, tough mother fucker.  **[answer](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4takhg?context=1) (waterontheknee):**  &gt; thank you! it is much appreciated.  *****  **[question](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4taav5?context=1) (janitor_bg):**  &gt; were there any other symptoms or what is only the one sudden seizure that indicated something like that is going on? hope this shit doesn't come back, man, cancer is a bitch.  **[answer](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4talua?context=1) (waterontheknee):**  &gt; i was experience headaches and mood swings, but i just attributed those to being stressed from school, drinking too much, and just kind of being depressed. but those didn't seem too out of the ordinary because again, i was still in school and stressing about finishing and all that. &gt;  &gt; after the seizure, my doctor (and my therapist who i only go to see as a personal support...its nice having someone who is pretty objective and has a medical license) have both told me that because of where my tumor is located that the symptoms of anxiety, depression, mood swings, headaches, are all consistent with what was going on in my head.  *****  **[question](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4tagdt?context=1) (vviikkrraanntt):**  &gt; are you in any kind of physical pain? &gt;   **[answer](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4tant2?context=1) (waterontheknee):**  &gt; i actually feel great right now. i run several times a week, go to the gym, and i'm working too jobs. i try to keep myself busy because then i don't get a chance to dwell on something that is out of my control. i get headaches sometimes still, but they're never really bad. &gt;  &gt; during treatment was a different story. the temodar has mild side-effects compared to other forms of chemo (another attribute to the "best" kind of brain cancer one can get). it was mostly nausea, feeling exhausted and tired, and my favorite: constipation. i was able to work around the latter by just eating better to keep things regular. there were a couple cycles where i wasn't regular and it was difficult to be around me because i was being such a jerk.  *****  **[question](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4taslp?context=1) (i_minored_in):**  &gt; i'm sorry to hear that.  my mom is on the tail end of battling breast cancer.  what is your expected life expectancy?  awesome scar though!!! i bet you can pull some ladies with it :)  **[answer](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4tauxr?context=1) (waterontheknee):**  &gt; life expectancy varies. being young and having a good reaction to the treatment i could have anywhere from 5-20 years. i met a guy who is a 19 year survivor and he had just started his temodar treatments. i guess i am kind of approaching this with the attitude of "if i make it to 40 i'm going to be the happiest 40 year old ever"! &gt;  &gt; the scar actually is barely noticable now. my hair has grown in and i haven't cut it short in over a year. you can't even tell i had my head cut open (unless you feel the area where they went in. there is a slight depression on the left side of my skull above my left eye/forehead). &gt;  &gt; all the best to your mom for her battle. there has been loads of advancements in breast cancer treatment so i hope it goes well!  *****  **[question](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4tatvl?context=1) (soigroeg):**  &gt; have you start believing in supernatural things you hadn't believed before? like god, of any kind of afterlife?  **[answer](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4taxs8?context=1) (waterontheknee):**  &gt; i've never been a believer in any specific religion, they all seem to have the credo of "treat everyone fairly" which is what i've been trying to do since all of this started. &gt;  &gt; as for the afterlife: i'm not sure what that is going to be like. i suppose i think it could be similar to being in a coma, which was like....nothing. i just woke up and regained consciousness.  *****  **[question](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4tb526?context=1) (jonasthomson):**  &gt; first of all, my dad had brain cancer in the late 70's incurable to, he got over it and is living till this day, so dont give up. &gt;  &gt; second in which part of the brain is it located and if so did it affect you in a weird/funny way like, speaking gibberish or something like that?  **[answer](/r/iama/comments/u8sla/_/c4tb6gh?context=1) (waterontheknee):**  &gt; well that's great to hear! what kind of cancer is it, if you don't mind me asking? &gt;  &gt; it's in my left frontal lobe, i had issues with mulitasking, mood swings, and headaches. knowing about it helps me manage it, so it's almost a non-issue at this point.   *****  (continued below)

t3_3xfghf-t3_3xfghf-cy4c6us	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	bisexuality was something which hit me very abruptly in my mid-teens. i've never been able to come up with any explanation for that, even considering some of the wackier theories.  i didn't develop any sexual feelings toward other guys until i was 16. that happened almost literally overnight, was *very* disconcerting, and left me dealing with this "stranger to myself" thing for a fair while. it really was *that* incongruous compared to anything i'd ever thought or felt toward anyone of my own gender, and for a while i seriously thought i had brain cancer or something. i have had numerous people try to tell me i was just "suppressing" before that, but i've never been able to come up with any memory of any thought or feeling which supports that idea, no matter how hard i've tried.

t3_2kx3gb-t3_2kx3gb-clprsqy	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7366	my daughter has epilepsy and has had seizures since she was two. her head did the exorcist twist thing, too. very freaky. when she was on depakote, she stopped having them for 5 years. we took her off and she has them again. she's now on oxcarbazepine and it seems ok, bit i'd prefer better. when she does have them now, they are right before she wakes up from a full nights sleep.  my father had brain cancer (not saying that's what's going on with her) and towards the end 13 years ago) he had grand mal seizures where he'd tense up but would shake violently and would have that look of absolute terror on his face, eyes wide just like you described. but no words were said. definitely kept me awake for a while and still haunts my dreams to this day. it's definitely scary. she could possibly be having night terrors as well. my younger daughter has those and screams bloody murder for 2-30 minutes. no calming her. eyes either closed or open.  man, i dunno. i'm sorry. i hope you can find answers our some relief for her. do you live in a state where medical marijuana or canibidol oil is legal? that could very well help with relieving all of it.

t3_3g7nfq-t1_ctwbjd1-ctwby07	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.8375	yeah, the rule of "anonymity + audience = total dickwad" and all that makes sense. it's simply *easier* to behave more poorly when you're faced with less consequences.  but that doesn't dismiss what i've said. there are other reasons for why they may be frustrated. very few people actually vent their frustrations or deal with their frustrations as well as they could and it often means that they harm others in the process.   i'm not going to dismiss the person as "bad" just because they had an unhealthy vent that i know of. i've pursued conversations after i've been told that i have brain cancer and gotten reason out of them, and tried to help. you don't get anything by thinking they're bad except a negative mentality and they don't get anything because you and others that think similarly don't give them help.

t3_37a1oz-t3_37a1oz-crl72g1	brain_cancer	relevant	0.5925	**tl;dr – 1) lost some hearing in my right ear, 2 doctors said nerve damage, found a benign mass, gone after brain surgery. 2) slept with contacts in, woke up with painful eye. thought it was an eye infection, optometrist discovers 5 corneal ulcers. almost lost eyesight but end up keeping it.**   first: as a sophomore in college, i spent about 2 months complaining about my cell phone being broken. this was due to the fact that i couldn't understand what anybody was saying to me whenever they called. one day, i pick up a call while i'm driving and switch hands to make a turn. while doing this i realize two things: 1) my phone is working beautifully and i could hear them crystal clear and 2) it wasn't my phone that was broken, my hearing on my right side was broken. so, i tell my parents, and go see an ent. this doctor took a look, did a hearing test, and told me it was just nerve damage, there was nothing he could do, and that i should listen to my music with less volume...   my father didn't like this diagnosis, and thought it was odd i was losing hearing in only one ear and not both, so we sought a second opinion. the second doctor said the same thing, it was most likely nerve damage; however, since i was only 19 at the time, and was only losing my hearing in my right ear, she sent me for an mri, just to rule out anything else. this was even though she thought it was just nerve damage.   two days later i'm in class and i get a phone call. being the good student i was (go ahead and laugh, i just did) i let it go to voicemail and during my break went to check it (using my good ear that is). it's my mother, who says, and i quote: "hey wafflechipbball, we got a call from your doctor, and she found a small mass in your ear canal. call me when you get a chance........" terrified that i had cancer (brain cancer), and in shock, i went back to class and sat numbly through a religious studies lecture. once the shock wore off and fear set it, i called back only to hear "oh it's most likely benign, i didn't mention that?".......... 9 hour brain surgery 8 months later and no more mass. also no more hearing, but hey, it wasn't brain cancer!  aaaaand second: this is a much shorter story. i had many complications following the surgery, one of which was temporary facial paralysis on my right side. this meant i couldn't close my right eye entirely, even when i slept (cue sleeping with eye lube and saran wrap taped to my face). this left me susceptible to getting a really dry eye. months later, i make the decision to sleep with my contacts in aka i forgot to take them out before i passed out. when i woke up, my eye was uncomfortable. i rubbed it a bit, and it started hurting pretty bad. by the end of the hour, i was in so much pain i couldn't open my eye. i thought i had an eye infection, so my cousin (who i was staying with at the time) took me to the er. the er doctor said in relative terms "fuck if i know? go see an optometrist." the optometrist took one look, and said "what the.... did you sleep with contacts in?" i said yes. he said "ok, well you have not one, not two, but five corneal ulcers." i was told i might then lost my eyesight on the same side i was completely deaf, which kinda sucked... thankfully, i retained my sight, although i do have a scar on my eye which follows my sight wherever i look...   have you ever had an ulcer inside your mouth? have you ever touched it with your tongue to see if it was still there only to have it sting with every touch? well imagine that pain. in your eye. every time you blink.....

t3_4xo2za-t3_4xo2za-d6h9exg	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i was visiting my friends at the university i'm attending (high school senior at the time, friends were freshmen in college) and we decided to do shrooms. after way too much tripping and paranoia i for some reason diagnosed myself with depression and called the cops on myself while sitting on the curb. the cop was cool and took me to a hospital and i began to have a panic attack when i said my friend's name, thinking that they would get in legal trouble for shrooms or whatever. the worst part came when two nurses began whispering to each other (probably laughing at how bad i was tripping) and i began fearing for my life. i had been diagnosed seizure prone for about 3 months and in my shroom dazed trip i was convinced those nurses were saying i had brain cancer with only minutes to live. i called my dad to come and hear my last rites and was telling my will to the cops as well as everything i wanted my brothers to do that i never got to do. it was scary believing i would die on that table having accomplished nothing in life, but maybe that's why i said i was depressed and called the cops in the first place. after too much tripping my dad finally showed up, and then i passed out and had a seizure. i truly felt like i experienced death and all its fears that night and i will never forget looking into that light before i seized.  tldr; shroom induced paranoia made me think i had terminal brain cancer and 5 minutes to live
t3_3ovfkq-t1_cw0rwet-cw0uwyv	brain_cancer	relevant	0.6508	a year ago my doctor scanned my brain a bunch and then told me that he strongly suspected i had a form of inoperable brain cancer. they had to do a biopsy to confirm, but if it came back positive i'd immediately start radiation therapy and possibly chemo.  this was in early december 2014. i had just married my wife that august and she was already pregnant with our first baby.   i was miserable. it was shitty. like tb, the cancer they suspected was in there had a median survival time of ~4 years, but i was younger than most who had it. but that didn't make me positive or motivated or optimistic. i was a grumpy, lazy and depressed person for weeks leading up to that surgery.  i went under the knife just before christmas. all the tests came back negative. there was no cancer, no parasite, no virus, no fungus, nothing. apparently i'm just epileptic and the swelling they mistook for a tumour might have just been caused by stress, anxiety or sleeplessness.  so i don't really know how tb is feeling. i went through a fraction of what he's going through for only a few weeks, and it really wrecked me. the fact that this is his second time through the ringer and he's being this positive is incredibly commendable.  good luck, john!

t3_4z43e3-t3_4z43e3-d6twmz4	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i don't know how to say what i need to say, but i'm going to try my best.  when i started meditation i realized two things :  - being in the present is being aware of what happens around you, the same way you react to your waking alarm every morning.  - when you start thinking or overthinking things you are no more in the present thus you are less reactive to what is around you.  being in the present doesn't mean to have no thougths. it just means to focus your thinking and apply it to your surroundings. a good example of this is when you focus while doing a team sport or just solving a puzzle of logic. at these moments you are in the present because you react to what is around you. and to me this is what meditation is all about, the only difference being you're not doing anything.  when you start thinking or overthinking you run through your mind a lot of scenarios about one subject. and the mind is the worst friend for this because it's very good for creating catastrophic scenarios that will make you feel sad or afraid of certain situations that are not real. one example i have for this is being afraid to go see a doctor because of repeated headaches. at first your thought process is like this :   - "ow a headache"  - then it becomes "ow, another headache"  - and after the tenth headache you'll have in the same week, you might say to yourself "i might have brain cancer"  - and finally telling yourself "i don't wanna go see a doctor, what if he tells me i have brain cancer"  but all these scenarios don't mean you have cancer (fantasy), it just means you have headaches (fact). it might just mean you need glasses.  you can put it this way :  - being in the present is about reacting to things when they happen to you, not trying to avoid some scenarios or reliving things you would have wanted to have happened differently  - not being in the present is about being in your fantasies whether they're positive or negative and take the risk to take bad decisions or simply miss great opportunities. because positive thinking can be as bad as negative thinking if not managed properly. and, who knows, maybe because of not being in the present, you might not see this girl/boy that could be the one you were waiting/searching for (just an exemple, you can adapt that the way you want).   tl;dr : to me meditation is a way to control the fantasies that can go through my mind and keep my head clear so i can react properly to what happens around me.

t3_1al2ud-t3_1al2ud-c8z3k7d	brain_cancer	relevant	0.755	getting the documentation fro mthe hospital is proving to be a pain in the ass so, without proof, i will just answer your questions here. my answer contrasts with that of kandis101. i was diagnosed with brain cancer about 3 months ago at the age of 20 and was given 2 to 5 years to live.   1. i really want to see mumford &amp; sons play and outdoor concert. it has been my dream for a long time and it is slowly becoming a reality as i am saving every penny to be able to afford to go this august. i also want to finish my degree before i die. i am in my 3rd out of 5 year of chemical engineering and it just seems like a waste of a large portion of my life if i don't finish. another big bucket list item is to travel out of the country and ideally somewhere warm (i am from canada). i don't have enough money to do this so i doubt very much that it will happen, but i am hoping.  2. my family doesn't know. i am not very close to my parents and my little sister is 15 and having a rough time at life with my parents' divorce this year so i don't want to throw this on her just yet. i don't plan on telling my parents anytime soon. i just told my best friend last weekend (on the advice of reddit, so thanks) and she took it really well. we are both being more consistant with making time to see each other and she is very positive and helpful about it. i don't think she is treating me any differently which is a big plus.  3. i can't really say how i am handling it because it varies so much on any given day. i would say that most days i am taking it well. i don't let it get me down too much and i can go a few days without thinking about it. but other days, i feel so sad that it is hard to get out of bed. when i was first diagnosed, i went absolutely crazy. i didn't leave my room (excepting neccessities) for 26 days. i didn't talk to anyone and i was contemplating killing myself.   4. my biggest regret is not having fun in my teenage years because i was so concerned about my future. i told myself that i would have fun once i had a stable job and life. and since i will never have that, it feels like all my hard work and sacrificing was for nothing. on the flip side, i think that those sacrifices and all that hard work made me into the person i am today. and i quite like this person :)  5. the hardest thing, by far, was telling my best friend and wrestling with the idea of telling other friends and family. i am still very stressed out about having to tell people in the future. i want to live my life normally and don't like pity or atention. so maintaining normalcy is hard. also, i have been seeing a guy for about 3 months now and he doesn't know. i don't know whether i should avoid getting involved romantically because there is no future for us. but the game plan is to tell him eventually and let him take the next step.  i hope you got all the answers you are looking for. feel free to hit me up with more questions.

t3_3qtpsk-t1_cwii6ea-cwikklg	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	it is a fair question, and not an asshole one at all. in another response, we had taken her to a vet and a specialist that day, and neither suggested putting her down. she was fine 2 days ago. they gave us meds and a schedule in which to give her them. there was a slight chance she may have had a brain tumor but she was not showing significant signs that it was leaning that way. it was unexpected. the worst part was that there was hope, and that it was taken minutes away from when we got her meds to get better. after we took her back to the vet to get cremated and describing what happened, the doctor believes it was a brain tumor and something burst, most likely in her brain.

t3_32fhan-t3_32fhan-cqb9s59	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7529	i'd say that some do.  my aunt passed 5 years ago, she woke up one morning and couldn't walk, turned out she had a stroke. after a lot of investigating after she  passed, we found out that she had really bad lung cancer and didn't tell anyone (kept telling us it was pneumonia) and the cancer spread to her brain, and she had an aneurism, which caused her stroke.  anyway, she went unconscious before her boyfriend was able to call an ambulance (she kept insisting she didn't want the paramedics to see her nude, too) and they took her to hospital, where she was put on life support- tried to relieve the pressure on her brain but it didn't help, she was declared braindead the next morning. my cousin had to fly in to new york from colorado (a whole day of flying and sitting in airports) and we took her off of life support around 6pm the next day. she survived on her own for around 8-10 hours, but didn't pass until everyone left. my oldest cousin was going to stay the night, and she only left long enough to take her brother back to her apartment to sleep. before she even turned around to drive back, the doctor called her and told her that my aunt passed away.  while she may not have been conscious, we all felt that she somehow knew we all left so no one had to watch her body die.

t3_to97c-t3_to97c-c4ohhea	brain_cancer	relevant	0.7328	a couple:  first was finding my wife dead in our flat. she had hanged herself from the balcony and was non-responsive. panic? yes. irritated at the 999 dispatcher for asking retarded questions? yes. not a good time.  next was visiting my aunt to say goodbye. she had been diagnosed with an acute kind of brain cancer ([glioblastoma multiforme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glioblastoma_multiforme)). wikipedia lists a 5 year survival and in the best case it's 14%. my aunt's best case was 0%, mean survival 7.5 months. she would be alive for about 2.5 months.  the terrifying part was she knew who i was, she knew who she was and what had happened to her, she knew that she was going to die and there was nothing anyone could do about it. she stayed in bed the entire time i was there and wasn't allowed to smoke. not because it was bad for her health but because her function was so poor that she might drop the fag and start a fire. she was in such pain because the tumour was huge, in her head.  no, the terrifying part was she had the mental capacity of a ten year old with add. she could not hold a complex conversation because the tumour was in her language centres. she could form sentences and communicate but she would lose words and the sentences would be very staccato. pieces of her would poke through, but it was futiile, she would be dead very soon. the doctors were shocked she lasted as long as she did. i can't imagine knowing the clock is ticking very rapidly towards a painful death where your self disintegrates.  fuck cancer!
t3_149osm-t3_149osm-c7b7mk8	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	i had brain cancer when i was 19* (i'm 31 now). i'm gonna answer your question in a round-about way.  chemo is a helluva drug. if they don't dilute the small amount they give you into 2+ liters of saline solution iv, supposedly it would just eat a whole through your arm. now, because i was young and have a strong stomach, the nausea didn't bother me near as much as other people. what got to me was how it affected all of my bodily fluids. my saliva had a permanent metallic, plasticy taste. i could smell the same metal/plastic smell because of the mucous in my nasal passages. my body oils made my skin feel the same way. the smell from my urine was so strong that after urinating, i had to take a shower because just being in the room with the urine made me stink that same...metal/plastic flavor.  now to answer your question, cancer doesn't feel like anything. for me, at least. people don't die from cancer per se, they die from the associated organ failure or whatever. so in that example, cancer would feel like organ failure. for me, the only "feeling" i had from cancer was visual problems caused by one of the tumors pressing on that part of my brain--which was great for me, because if it wasn't for that i probably would have found out about the cancer too late.  also, "cancer" is a fairly broad category of things. different cancers happen because of different biological issues that come up. (i'm not a biological person, so that's as much as i know.)  as for the emotional feelings, that's something else entirely. cancer is a funny way to die. not haha funny, obviously, but because it is often harder to accept someone you love slowly dying than to slowly die yourself. so it is often that the dying person is comforting the people who are perfectly healthy.  hope that answers your question, and i'd love to hear when other who've had cancer think about what i said.  *if you plan on getting cancer, i highly suggest getting it when you're young. if you get it when you're old, your body and evolution don't give a shit about you because you're not going to have any more offspring.
t3_2drdzj-t1_cjsf08q-cjsmlcf	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.67	when i was 13 i was diagnosed with a lymphoma and had to undergo 4 chemos with 2 weeks of staying at home between them. i lost and gained 20 pounds between each session. i threw up blood, the inside of my mouth was like an open wound so i could barely eat or even talk. the cancer itself never caused any pain, the chemo did. now 4 years later my doctors consider me as cured and i'm happy everyday for the support of my doctors and my family. it really does suck being diagnosed with cancer. i still remember how the doctor broke it to me. i felt like my life would end there as i had just lost my grandmother to brain cancer two years back. this shit just fucks you up but my will to live on may have helped with my disease. i continued school afterwards in the same class i was in before and graduated high school this year with very good grades.

t3_r8hp2-t3_r8hp2-c476v91	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	i have brain cancer as well (grade 4 aa, or gbm), was diagnosed about a year ago. the nih in bethesda, md will consult with you/treat you for free. they will even fly you out there and help with food and lodging if you are enrolled in one of their protocols. there is one protocol that i'm in that simply gathers information about your demographic background for a database. they also have several other clinical trials that you may be eligible for, and as others have mentioned, there are clinical trials all over the country that pay for all care that is involved with the study.  look on clinicaltrials.gov for ones you are eligible for. research hospitals (duke, ucla, mgh) generally have the most state-of-the-art stuff going on, but do your research and try to talk to the principal investigator of the trial.  did your doctor tell you it was a "medical certainty" that you'll die in 3-5 years? though the median survival time is short, there are incidences of long-term survival. i know that you can't assume it'll be you, but you should know that it does happen and it's worth fighting.  also, i want to mention that i've had radiation and have been on chemo for a year. temodar (i assume that's what you'd be prescribed) is probably the mildest chemo out there. my experience with treatment hasn't been too bad. i slept a little more during radiation. chemo gets me a little fatigued but not enough that my friends and family can even notice. i do volunteer work at an eeg lab and my peers don't even know i have cancer/take chemo. i realize there are plenty of other reasons to decide not to go through radiation/chemo, but if quality of life is the main problem for you, you might be surprised at how mild the effects of conventional treatment are.  i don't know the details of your symptoms, but the fact that you've been having them for so long might be a sign that your tumor is slower-growing or progressed from a lower grade malignancy. this may be a favorable prognostic indicator.  i use a vaporizer daily for weed. there are some studies suggesting it might kill some glioma cell lines. just sayin'.  don't give up. my chances of surviving even 2 more years are estimated at about 20%. the way i think of it is: if i had some other disease with a 20% chance of death in the next two years, i'd still be pretty terrified, so i should be an equivalent amount of hopeful that i might make it until they come up with something better.

t3_3gt35m-t3_3gt35m-cu1a1cm	brain_cancer	relevant	0.677	i had depression since i beat brain cancer when i was just 6 years old.   at the age of 9 i recognised it as depression.   after 19 years, suicide attempts and complete discontent, i finally decided i was worth more.  it took just over a year to find the perfect antidepressant that worked for me, after dozens of failed attempts. (never lose hope) took three therapists and then the most perfect psychiatrist.   it took admitting it to myself and my family, and understanding that it was a disease and not a personality trait.   now i've been on 100mg pristiq for 3 years. i felt happy for the first time on it.  now i love myself,  see worth in everything.   i still have major depressive disorder, and i always will. never as bad as it was for those decades that i refused to help myself. it's under control. like asthma with puffers.   all of you with depression, i know hope is few and far between, but somewhere in there,  you know you're worth trying.   love you all

t3_3u0gwe-t3_3u0gwe-cxd26yf	brain_cancer	relevant	0.6658	lots of good advice here but i wanted to add a bit more. my husband was diagnosed with a glioblastoma several years ago. his battle was short but it felt much longer. i saw it as an opportunity to make his final days as good as possible. there weren't any big trips planned but lots of family time.  some practical things for you to know:   explore hospice options near your mother (assuming you do not live nearby) or consider having her get treatment near you and explore local hospice options.  brainhospice.com is a resource that can give you a good idea of what to expect at each stage of her illness. it helped me to understand what i was seeing with my husband.  learn about her treatment and expected side effects, steroids are often used with brain tumors to reduce swelling since that can be terribly painful. if she is given temodar, ask her doctor what the max dose of colace your mom can have as temodar is incredibly constipating.  steroids can interfere with her sleep, encourage her to talk to her doctor about a good sleep aide.  arrange for her to sleep with her head elevated at home. morning headaches can be brutal with brain tumors and sleeping with the head elevated can help a lot.  make sure your mother executes a durable power of attorney and medical power of attorney so decisions can be made without problems.  radiation will make her lose her hair. look into organizations like henna heals to help her cope with that.  steroids will make her puffy and hungry all the time.   let her be angry, it's a tough diagnosis. she will go through all the stages of dying, try to be there as support for her during those phases.   if your mom is still of working age, have her apply for disability now.   spend time talking with her, being with her, looking at photos together.   take time to take care of yourself or to just cry.  feel free to pm me if you have questions or just need to vent/talk with someone who has been down the same road. my thoughts and prayers will be with you.

t3_1riazr-t1_cdnnila-cdnxp5i	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i was 12 when my grandma died.  she had cancer and lived with it for a while before finally letting it go.  after she said her last words you could tell she was gone.  her body was still breathing and lying in bed, but what made her "her" was in heaven.  a couple days before her body stopped, i had a dream where she and i were sitting in her back yard.  she was younger looking and happy, and she told me she got to be 25 again and was with her husband.  she was happy and excited and told me not to worry because everything was ok.  i still cry whenever i think about her even though i'm 25 now, but that dream really helped me.  i think it was her because it was exactly everything she would say.  another time, but when it was daytime and i was fully awake (so no weird nighttime brain tricks), i looked out the window to my bedroom which was so close to my neighbor i could see into her kitchen.  i saw my neighbor walking around, doing laundry or walking from her bathroom to her living room (the kitchen separated them).  right when i saw her i thought "she's dead".  i asked my mom about it and my neighbor had died a few days prior and her cremated remains were sitting in her usual chair in her house... but nobody had bothered to tell me.  i think a lot of the dead still hang around or stop by from time to time but they are generally nice and more intent to take care of their family than be malevolent.

t3_q4ggj-t1_c3vqutg-c3vv6l5	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i became severely anxious last spring after thinking i was seriously sick (turns out it was just cold pneumonia which triggered a lot of physical anxiety symptoms.) . before that i was just merely slightly anxious. pretty well off. afer that i was in this anxiety hell for the past 10 months. but i would like to say that i am feeling better.  so yes. it can stop. it can get better. but you have to stop grasping on to your pain. you have to stop defining yourself by it. even if it is a constant feeling. you have to literally force yourself to do things that give you pleasure. things that make you forget your self. your anxiety. do not pay too much attention to it. because the more attention you pay to it, the stronger it gets. you can not deny it. but you can pay attention to other things. if you can not find someone. maybe get a pet?  as a example. i remember one particular june day last year. i had not slept at night. yet, it was a beautiful day. i felt like 100 year old. completely out of it. anxiety burning on my skin.  afraid that maybe i can not sleep the next night either. (a thought which always makes me more anxious, which is why i try not to think it) but i got this idea that i should go to the beach with my wife. it turned out to be a glorious day at the beach. a memory i still savor. especially because that glorious day was during some of my worst anxiety. it was there with me on that beach. i was feeling like a zombie. but i recognized the smiles on the faces of people. the freedom of seagulls flying about. constantly rejecting anxious thoughts. not sure if i had a brain cancer or just anxiety. i was able to pay attention that i had been "blessed" with that day. thankful.  on purely scientific level. paying attention to other things. like a pet. has a real basis. which is the fact that you have mirror neurons. when you look at something external. you feel what it feels. if you look at a person smiling, you smile inside. if you look at a pet playing, you feel playful inside. if you look at calm lake, with birds singing in the distance. you feel that calm.   now you can do that wrong.   (i am not saying that being introverted is wrong, but that when you are anxious. you need to look at the  world instead of concentrating on your self. because that is where the pain is. i used to enjoy being in my head. but after my anxiety break, my brain has not been a good place to be.)  you can look at the world and judge it. you can let it trigger anxious memories. but when you do it without judgement. when you just look. now. not in light of your past. you let the world into your mind. you are free of this thing you call self for a moment. and you change. when you look at someone smiling, you smile inside. even if you are not capable to smile yourself. but if you do it for long time enough. the feeling catches.   you clearly know how you want to feel. so you have a capability to feel better.   (lets go on about better here for a while.. better is a dualist term. but the thing is. you are not  wanting to feel better as opposed to worse. . you want pain to stop. which means that you want to  come back towards neutral..)  but you have conditioned yourself into thinking that you can only feel better if x happens. that is attachment thinking. it suggests that if x wont happen, you have to feel miserable. it is wrong. you do not have to feel miserable. there are things out there right now that if you saw. would bring a smile to your face. seek out those things.   actually, you probably have capability to feel euphoria right now. total opposite of anxiety. it is just that you have locked down in this anxious state. somehow, your subconscious mind has come up with anxiety as a solution. it wants you to not look out. it wants you to concentrate on your anxious self. but we know that is not solution. that only aggravates it.    it is anxiety cycle. you feel anxious. you start to pay attention to pain. you feel more anxious.   you break it by opening your eyes and paying attention to other things.   most likely anxiety to you is a signal saying that you are deeply uncomfortable with your life. and you have lived with it for such a while that it feels like you are never going to get rid of it. because it is no one thing. it is multitude of things you are not happy with. it is a constant reminder that your brain wants things to change.  well. nothing is stopping you. you can go out and look at the world.  without judgement, without reflection on your self. open to see that you do not know how everything is. humble. able to understand that the world is more wondrous that you can possibly understand. let go of your pre judgement.   then slowly. you may start getting back towards neutral. or even surpass neutral feeling and feel happy. .

t3_4m8o44-t1_d3u1e5v-d3u1u1n	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i was a baby, three months old, and it was removed by the time i was one. i remember only the after math, but sure. i had to get yearly checks for cancer, as i had a 40% chance of it coming back in either my brain or lungs until i was 11. then, it switched to every other year. the tests consist of ct scans, an mri (i find it redundant that they need both, but oh well), blood work, and some other checks, like seeing if any scar tissue was getting out of control, or if i had any bumps.  the dye lie was because i hated ct scans, and the thought of drinking something let that freaked me out. eventually they realized i respond to needles better, and we went with that from then on. i once had a really big scare, as i had a combo of both mono, and another virus almost exactly like it, making me sleep 19 hours a day. my doctor told my mom it was a good chance that i had brain cancer, as nobody even thought of mono due to the fact that i had caught another virus a year prior with, again, identical symptoms.  i had a ct scan that time, and another time i had a bone scan, which was the absolute worst because i had to remain completely still between two full body x-ray boards. no pillow or anything, i wasn't allowed to use the restroom, so they gave me diapers. i was 9 when i had the bone scan, and 10 with mono. both of these times i honestly thought i'd have cancer, and was more worried about my mom than me.  i got sick a lot, when i was 3 i had the immune system of a 65 year old aids patient. i also had such extreme radiation treatment i would have set off alarms in a nuclear power plant for three years. other than having a shit immune system until i was around 10 years old, i've been fine. i have one testicle, so i ejaculate a lot less than most guys, but that's to be expected. i am down to the same chance of getting cancer again as the average person, and my immune system is better than most now, as i've built immunities to so many diseases.  but yeah, it's pretty chill. i sometimes go to relay for life and get free stuff, but i feel like an imposter since i was so small when i had it. i live a very normal life with no long lasting consequences, and i'm pretty happy with my situation overall.

t3_p9zqy-t1_c3nslz6-c3nte9k	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	this is such a worn-out and weak argument that reveals a very poor understanding of economics.  you're far from the first and, i'm sure, far from the last liberal to tell me that businesses can't make profits off of things that take a long time to pay for themselves. and it's a specious and laughable claim every time it's made.  there are millions of examples of capitalized future interest returning immediate profits to producers. cars, for example, produce utility over a period of five to twenty years, and may not pay for themselves until long after they are produced. yet automobile manufacturers see quarter-over-quarter profits because people pay upfront the capitalized value of the utility they anticipate receiving.  houses are a more extreme example, producing utility over a period more on the order of twenty to two hundred years. many houses continue to be valuable long after the construction workers who built them have died. yet those workers still got paid wages at the time they built the house, not later. office buildings and universities push the limit even further, lasting several centuries, and _still_ the construction workers are paid upfront, not later.  charitable functions, too, can follow this model. i have donated money to brain cancer research, as have millions of other people around the world. the money i've donated has probably already produced some amount of positive returns, but i highly doubt it has produced a _net_ positive return. however, the awesome thing about research is that the information that is learned through research is useful not just at the time that it is learned, but all the time for the remainder of the existence of human civilization. i have a strong feeling that the money i donated will _eventually_ produce a net positive return, and that is why i donated.
t3_3bqx1k-t1_cspcabe-cspcy8x	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	perhaps i could have been clearer. i was trying to delineate her mind at rest and her mind afflicted by her depression. i do not mean to state that i am dead set against her decision, simply that i think this case raises a significant number of important ethical questions that do not seem to be addressed in this thread. namely: in most assisted suicide cases i have seen, the candidate must be proved to be of sound mind, in order to avoid a foggy or coerced mind forced into action it would not normally take. i have heard of brain cancer patients being turned away for this reason. the trouble with this case, and the ones of brain cancer, is that the affliction hoped to be solved through death by its very nature affects the organ that makes that decision. i don't have an answer, but here is the question: can a person demoralized by a rampant and uncontrollable set of emotions be ethically trusted to use that same set of emotions to end their own suffering? or do we as a society have an obligation to step in? these aren't rhetorical questions.   i just very much doubt that very many of those brandishing their libertarian values of "do what you want" at the top of this thread would, at the sight of a man standing on the railing of the golden gate bridge, simply walk by, shrugging to themselves as he steps into the abyss. the trouble, the impossible question, is how long we should hold on to that man's hand before we let go.

t3_493twh-t3_493twh-d0pflq0	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	so here's a fun story for you about how i went from complete zero back to being in complete control of my chops again.  on april 24th i suffered a seizure and was rushed to the hospital where i was diagnosed with a massive tumor in my brain, basically, they said i had brain cancer. my memory was extremely hazy and fuzzy, i could barely remember what day it was, or what was even going on. but here's the more surprising thing: i had completely forgotten how to play guitar. i had been playing for 15 years beforehand, professionally for 7, was a requested player for those that knew me, and a highly sought after teacher at my job. but, somehow, after having a seizure, i couldn't even remember what a goddamn c chord was.  i was like this for 3 months. i couldn't even imagine what in the hell was going on, i had to focus on doing other things because i couldn't do the one thing that i really loved to do, which was play guitar.  but thankfully, after multiple rounds of chemo, my brain started to come back into focus, slowly but surely, and i started to remember things. but here's the problem, not practicing for 3 months put a major dent in my time and my ability to play. and so, for the past 8 months i've been putting it back together, slow and steady. do my warm ups to a metronome, practice scales and chords to a metronome, relearn songs, ect.  it took time, but i'm finally back to normal now and am ready to get my career on track now that my cancer is gone.

"normal thoughts," is probably not a normal thing to think. need to put water in the iron. does it really matter if i use distilled water? probably not. maybe over years. i wonder if i use tap and then distilled, alternating, if the distilled would cancel out the tap. mother fucker, this stupid shit, i can't...  fuck. fuck it. there, no there's a new wrinkle. it says to people, "hey look! i took the time to iron today! i did a shitty job of it, but fuck you, i took the time to alter my appearance for you. appreciate it." good enough. okay. deodorant.   it's fucking cold in here. she's still asleep? is she going to miss work again today? maybe she was secretly fired and she hasn't been going to work at all. maybe she is having an affair. she spends a lot of time texting people. i really don't think she would do that, why would she do that? she's a pragmatist, if she wanted to cheat she would just leave me.   i wonder why we still have to brush our teeth. it seems so primitive. didn't cavemen do this with a stick and hair or something? there should be a better method.   i hate styling my hair. fucking hate this. it never looks good. well, they say it looks good, but it never does what i want it to, it just does what it wants. ugh. do i want to grab anything for lunch? what time is it?  fuck, i should have gotten up on time. 7:15, i can be there by 7:45 if i speed. i always speed anyway, so it's not as if i won't be doing that. still in bed. i wonder if she's dying. maybe she has cancer or some kind of disease that hasn't been noticed yet. i should be nicer to her. i wonder if she can read my mind?  she's so warm. i wish i could crawl back into bed with her.   it's cold. npr always plays such bullshit in the morning, except for on wednesdays because frank deford is awesome. i mean, i realize everyone is still waking up, but c'mon, i don't need to hear bullshit local news about how the mayor of norco is going to attend some stupid fucking festival. fuck this guy, "i'm going to go 40 miles an hour because i have nothing important to do today." you're an asshole, buddy.   okay, we're getting on the freeway, let's act like we have somewhere to be... oh, really?

if you are being passed on both goddamned sides then you are in the wrong lane you stupid fuck.   okay, well, ya'll go off and do your shit, i'm getting away from you. ya'll. ya'll. i don't know why that seems so... comfortable and foreign at the same time. such a weird word or contraction or whatever. i wish i had magneto's powers so i could just throw these fucking cars off the freeway. isn't vosotros the spanish version of ya'll? i wonder how accurate that is.   oh, you fucking cunt. good for you, now you're in front of me, stuck behind the same guy i was 5 seconds ago. i mean shit, i'm in a hurry too, but you're just driving like a dipshit, neither of us are going any faster than the other lanes.   can i make my exit if i pass this guy? ughhhh i... he looks like he drives like a dumbass, i'm going to pass him. oop. oh shit. oh shit, sorry, sorry, fuck, sorry, okay. i made it. oh shit, that guy's still behind me. should i wave? no, he still seems mad. oh well. hey, fuck you, i waved man, i'm sorry, i had to.   i don't recognize that homeless guy. maybe he's not just a grifter, maybe he's really homeless. i'm not going to give him anything, i've given too much away to those fucking con artists.   that's the shame of it really. the guys that i never see again are probably legitimate, but i won't know  who isn't legitimate unless i never see them again, so there's only a negative confirmation. no positive. fuck it, it doesn't really matter, it isn't as if i'm going to really change a life with 5 dollars.   annnnd who parked in my spot? i wish these spots were assigned, but c'mon, you see a car parked there every day and *you* have to park there? what happened to *your* spot? i ain't parking under that tree and getting my shit all sappy, fuck that.   okay. do i have to greet that guy? did he see me? no, i'll pretend i didn't see him.   emails... mostly bullshit. i should respond to her, since she's important, but it won't actually take any work, so i can put it off for a bit. i wonder how much it would hurt if i stabbed my letter-opener through my hand. i bet i could kill three or four people with it before someone stopped me. i dunno, people would probably run away after i got one or two, and then it would be over.   i wonder, if i was *really* determined, if i could get away with stuff like that.  probably everyone who does it assumes they can. wait why are these numbers wrong? no, no no...  oh bitch. i didn't include the mid-quarter numbers from last year. fuck.   should i tell anyone about this, or should i just redo it all? if i tell them i'll look responsible and honest, but if i just fix it without saying anything i'll look like less of a fuck up. i think i just won't say anything.   was that my phone? no, no new texts or anything. feels like it is always going off. i wonder what we're eating for dinner. i wonder if i should start it when i get home. did she go to work? fuck, she better have, she can't keep missing work all the time. i should find out how she is doing. after she responds i'll check about dinner.  time to poop. i'm getting paid to sit here and play with my phone. i'm getting paid to shit. i kind of feel guilty. i wonder how dirty the toilet seat is. i wonder how many surfaces in here have shit or urine on them. i want to graffiti something clever but i can't think of anything and everyone knows my handwriting. they probably don't actually, i'm just being self-important. i really hope this guy leaves soon. what are you even doing? just pee and get out. well, fuck it, i guess i'll just wait. candy crush is so fucking irritating, i don't even know why i play this game. if i drop my phone in the toilet would i still use it or would  get a new one?  can i *afford* to get a new one? better than talking on a shit-phone. it is *my* shit though. how is that better? better than someone else's shit, i guess. i bet i could get away with not washing my hands, but that's disgusting.   she's pretty hot. if i was single i probably wouldn't date her, but i don't mind looking at her. she has nice boobs. she doesn't seem like she'd be very good in bed. seems like she'd be kind of lazy. lay there and make you do all the work. not like that intern, she seems eager to please. less pretty, but i bet she'd be fun. i wonder if anyone can read my mind? maybe that's why jenna is always grumpy maybe she knows what i'm thinking and secretly hates me but can't explain why because then i'd know.   well, i finished everything for today. it's still only 3. i could go and ask for another project, but i think i'll just kill the day on reddit. it isn't like i would get much done in 2 hours anyway, fuck, if i were my boss i would fire my ass.   it's 4. god time is passing so slow. maybe i should find something productive to do so that i can get the fuck out of here without things dragging so much. i wonder what i can't believe it's not butter is actually made out of. it's probably some pretty terrible shit. causes cancer i bet. i wonder if i have cancer. i would bet that i have prostate or lung cancer if i have cancer, but brain cancer might be interesting. maybe i'm slowly going crazy because of a growing tumor in my head. i wonder if i think the way other people think. maybe i'm secretly brilliant but i never realized it.   yeah because you do *so* much brilliant shit...   4:30. i could leave now and everyone would just assume i got here early like i usually do. i should stay though. fuck it i'm leaving.   at least everyone on the road right now is like me and they left early so they can just get home. except this guy. this guy doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. seeyah, guy.   i bet i could cause a horrific car accident if i swerved into that semi. block all the lanes, really fuck up traffic for a few hours. die, and be "that accident" that fucked up traffic and made people late. is that meaningful? i wonder if that's better than having nobody affected by your death at all. i bet that's why those crazy bomber people do that shit. just so that it seems like your life had *some* kind of impact, even if it has to be negative.   meanwhile, i work in spreadsheets all day. i should invent something. or build something. do something different and meaningful.   why the fuck is it always so cold in here?

i remember seeing my only daughter, now long dead, as a hundred year old woman. she was to me, the *next generation*. it was strange, i sought out and found one of my great descendants, the resemblance to my little girl had brought tears to my eyes. now they too are dead.  i try to stay away from my family now. it only brings sadness every time i look at people who remind me of all that i have lost.   “i have witnessed empires rise and fall, wars fought and lost, children born, and the elderly die. from totalitarian regimes, to the utopia you kids have here.”almost non-existent crime, post-scarcity society, war was almost a thing of the past, hell  a computer with internet access in your brain that can create virtual simulations in your head instead of dreams, if they didn’t think this was a utopia, i’d like them to suggest what one might look like. “ to keep me for rambling on about the ‘good ole’ days’ i will take a suggestion of a topic.”  hundreds of hands went up, nearly every student wanted a question addressed. it was almost overwhelming. it would have ,in fact ,been overwhelming had it not been for my active stemware that managed to calculate the first student to raise their hand. the program in my mind highlighted the student three rows back. i pointed towards them, through force of habit, and our two systems communicated for a moment, letting him know he was chosen to ask. he was a young boy, likely about sixteen, his face lit up with he received his signal. he stood up and his stemware interfaced with the intercom i was using , allowing him to be heard by every student.   “ hi, uh, sir. can you tell us about nine hundred and eleven? we covered it in history a few weeks ago, but did things really change overnight like the history books said?”  “ah yes, by the way it was called *nine eleven* because of the date, and i suppose you could say things did change. i was in high school like you when it happened.” i remember it as if it were yesterday, mainly  because the stemware archives allows instant access to every memory i have. i was in a ninth grade computer class. it really did feel as if things had changed instantly. “ it was more of a *feeling* i suppose. don’t get me wrong, there were actually changes that happened. security was heightened all around the united states, the patriot act, the act that eventually undid the first union was passed thanks to the chaos, and the wars that followed did change the world.”  the wars… i remember them the most. i would not need my computer to remember those, i wish i could forget sometimes, the computer does help with that when it’s too much. i had fought with the marine infantry during the iraq war. i was mortal at the time, i knew because i had been shot in the shoulder and it had taken months, and mind numbing pain, for it to fully heal. nowadays it would take seconds. the fear i felt then, the fear of death, was something i can hardly comprehend anymore. the idea that at any moment you just wouldn’t *be*, it was horrible. these kids don’t know that terror just yet, i hope they never do. i’m not sure what was worse, the fear of it, or the acceptance of it. when in twenty sixteen i had been diagnosed with brain cancer, i had prepared to stop being alive. i had prepared to die , leaving my first wife and poor baby daughter behind. it just didn’t happen though. the cancer disappeared, the doctors were astonished. they had done surgery on the back of my head( barbaric by todays standards) to see if the could find any trace of it. they couldn’t , and when they closed my incision, it healed instantly.   from that moment on i wouldn’t die. i had gone to fearing leaving my family alone, to fearing watching them die. and i did watch them die, slowly. “…but what changed most was our view of the world itself, the world no longer felt safe. despite no terrorist attack ever equaling it’s measure since, people still feared it happening again. the world felt… aware.”  my eyes snapped open, force of habit, there was no point what with light itself dying several billion years ago. i had been having a great dream. my stemware has a way of sending me where i need to go at that time. i love my stemware, she is the only friend i have left. the heat death of the universe had snuck up on me. maybe if i had just spend more time studying, i could have found a way to bring a friend with me. to immortalize another human, or at least some sentient being. i missed them, all of them. the humans most of all. sure the wacky alien races were great too, at the very least someone to talk to. i truly longed to talk to my own people. i chuckle to myself, each sound i make defying the laws of physics. “my own people” , i stopped being human long before they died out. still, it was nice to look at people that looked like me.   i stared off into the darkness, my stemware readings have been scanning for anything for what seems like forever. i sigh and cross my arm, some of the last particles in the universe shake off of my body as it moves, flying into the distance to die like everything else. *why can’t the damn universe just…restart*. i set up my next dream, making sure this one would last at least a million years. what about the twelfth millennium , that super volcano made things interesting for a while.
t3_4ncqyz-t3_4ncqyz-d43aczx	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	my senior year my best friend was diagnosed with a glioblastoma (brain cancer). she was terminal from the beginning but wanted to fight it. she never told me and i prayed and just knew she could make it.   i went with her to get the port surgery so that they could give her chemo. i watched as she withered to 78 lbs, then ate dinner with her family while they injected liquid vitamins into the same port used for chemo because she couldn't eat. i watched her swell to 130lbs from the liquid food and rubbed lotion on the giant  two inch wide tears in her skin from stretch marks. i was there when her mother cried with her and cut off her tatty remaining hair. i was there when all of her friends couldn't handle it and faded into the back ground. i was holding her mothers hand while she cried because her friends also stepped away because of the gravity of the situation. i was there watching her poor little ten year old brother watching his only sister die a horrible slow god forsaken death.  i was at her funeral, listening to the christian songs she faithfully picked out for her own funeral.  me and god never made it up after that.

"you can go to court, risk the life sentence for murder, or you can join the three day rotation." he chuckled dryly. "i suppose that they think it's poetic justice."  i smiled, although i didn't find it funny. in three days, i was to go on trial for murder - i had deliberately passed on my brain cancer to a co-worker, by sneaking a bit of my blood into her soda one day. how was i to know that she was one of those weirdos who refused to transfer?  "what do you think my chances are in court?" i asked him, before i made my decision. he was supposed to be the best, after all.  "not good, i'm afraid," he said apologetically. "i can try to argue it down to manslaughter, since you didn't know, but... this is a new legal precedent, here, no one's ever killed with a transfer before. the judge doesn't want to deal with it, which is why he's offering the plea bargain, but, well..." he sighed. "i suspect that if it comes to it he'll come down heavily. do you still want to plead guilty?"  i shook my head. "i'll take the plea. i'll join the three day rotation."  he whistled, soft and low. "you're a brave man. three days a week of the dangerous diseases in the world?"  "and *four* days a week of being pampered and cared for," i pointed out. "besides, someone's got to do it. gotta keep the really bad ones out of circulation." malaria, hiv, ebola...  "true," he agreed. "still, it must be horrible... and you won't be allowed to leave the rotation like the volunteers can."  i shrugged. "can't be worse than the cancer."  *this is my first time answering a prompt, please give me criticism and/or advice.*

t3_2l42uv-t1_clrpjbo-clrqzg0	brain_cancer	relevant	0.6682	even if she took her own life because her death would suck, doesn't mean she didn't commit suicide.  she in fact committed suicide.  i know people who have ridden cancer out to the bitter end, she did not.  i have known people who have killed themselves for what no reason at all.  in the end she is in the category of people who committed suicide.  was it a good idea, maybe.  among those who clinged onto the end when given 6 months to live, at least 1 lived for 20 years mostly in good health, and another a bit more than 5 years.  i have a friend with terminal brain cancer and was given 3-4 months about 2 years ago -- though she is in clearly in the end run now.   if any of these people killed themselves, i would have understood.  being eaten alive by your own body is just terrifying -- but each would have lost their opportunity to live much longer.
t3_3swftj-t1_cx106oj-cx1muvs	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6068	yes. my husbands family is lds. he is the only one who is not in his in entire family. his family treats us as they treat anyone else in the family. we have gone to functions at the church. never any pressure to join.  in fact i was diagnosed with brain cancer last year and had surgery. lots of offers for help during that time, with no expectations even though my husband has not been active in 20 years. missionaries don't even come to our house anymore, but if i'm outside doing yard work or something, they will offer to mow my lawn. so in our case it hasn't been a big deal.

t3_3la0sq-t1_cv4kf3y-cv78546	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	you could say the same thing about career as a neurosurgeon. honestly, if i had brain cancer and needed surgery i would trust this man's judgement because he was, at one time, the undisputed best in his profession.  judge someone on their success and their actions, sure. but dont be so quick to judge someone on their views of the origin of life.
t3_tqrc0-t1_c4oyaa9-c4oyvjk	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	yea he acually is just some random kid. im not saying it sucks that he is going to die, but thats just the way it is. over 120,000 children under the age of 5 die a year because of starvation and i think it is kind of ridiculous to target some 6th grader and mark him as something special. if i was diagnosed with brain cancer tomorrow i wouldnt expect random people, oceans away, to sympathize with my unimportant plights so why should i care about him?
t3_xm2di-t3_xm2di-c5nkxzg	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i live in a fairly small community in comparison to some of the cities nearby (dc, richmond, norfolk) and i work in a taco bell in the town.   one night i'm working closing shift and my manager, let's call her elane because that's her actual name, was there to supervise as well as my older brother (who put in a recommendation for me). this family of three walks into the the lobby and elane greets them, she notices a bald child that looked frail. elane walks up to the child and says "you look like you feel sick, what's wrong?". this little boy looks up and just says "i have brain cancer". elane ended up rushing to the backroom in tears from the shock of it.  this kid, trent alan williams, aged 8, died as a result of cancer on sunday. i cannot begin to imagine the struggle that that family had to go through to put on a brave face for that child. i cannot begin to fathom how that child could face dying before even getting a decade into his life so bravely.   if you'll excuse me i'm going to go  cry or something. i just ruined my own day.

t3_275p85-t3_275p85-chxv8f7	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	oh man this hit hard. my cat died rather suddenly 2 weeks ago. she was by far the most special pet i've ever had and the loss is really hard to bear even weeks later.   a year ago, my girlfriend of 6 years had a sudden stroke and almost died. she had about 6-8 months of rehab ahead of her and couldn't work. she already suffered from depression, and it got a lot worse. when she was able to come home from the hospital, i took her to the shelter and we adopted an 11 year old cat who looked very similar to yours actually!   she was the sweetest cat i've ever had. she would snuggle with my girlfriend all day when  i was at school/work and was a huge help to her rehab process. she instantly became part of our small family. 8 months later, she got sick. we brought her to the vet, and got some medicine. 2 days later she died. we found out she had a brain tumor that we didn't know about. she died in my girlfriends arms on the way to the animal hospital to put her down  (she was in bad shape at that point).   we ended up having her cremated because she was so special to us but man seeing that urn daily is painful.   feel free to message me if you want, i know what you're going through.
t3_1ivl8u-t1_cb91j46-cb91p1w	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	they said it might be a slow bleed or a tumor. i have to get an mri, because they want to verify what they saw on the ct scan. i am waiting to hear back from radiology to schedule my mri, which should be tomorrow. it was supposed to be today, but it wasn't able to happen.   after the mri, i was told to immediately make an appointment with the neurosurgery clinic. i am really worried that it might be a tumor, since earlier this year they were considering that i had brain cancer before dismissing it, though they didn't run any tests for it.   hopefully it is just a small bleed that they can remove the pressure with a quick cut and i will be fine. do you have any advice to stop worrying until i have more information?
t3_2o5le9-t1_cmjyf69-cmk3srq	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i had a good friend who did brain cancer research.  they happened to know very little about politics.  like they didn't know fox was considered a right "leaning" news source.  after reading 1 book i've never heard of from some author i've never heard of they developed some very strong fringe feelings about politics.  why should the rich pay taxes or whatever.  anyhow we were "debating" politics once and i made a pretty well established point to them.  something you could easily source from msnbc fox or bbc.  they said because they were a scientist this wasn't good enough and they needed more sources/evidence.  they were a scientist and it's how their brain worked.  the same person who formed their passionate feelings from *one fringe book*.

t3_12ie4v-t3_12ie4v-c6vbf49	brain_cancer	relevant	0.668	my mother was diagnosed with malignant thyroid cancer when she was 19 years old. they told her show would not live another year (this was back in the late 70's) they decided to take a radical path and remove her thyroid and the mass and managed to save her life despite the odds they had stacked against her. she's had a rough life, mostly taking a lot of medication (often times we could not afford due to jobloss) to do the job of her thyroid.   within 2 years of the surgery she was experiencing some lighteheadedness and ear pain, she had another malignant mass in her brain that ate through her ear canal. she has lost all hearing in that ear (and her douchey fiance dumped her while they did chemo) but they managed to save her life again.   her cancer has come back a few times in odd places but she's been lucky to have something to hold onto...something to fight to live for.  your girlfriend has her entire life a head of herself....tell her she needs to fight for that life. tell her to hang in there not for you, or her family, or her fear...but for a future she can actively be a part of and enjoy despite whatever complications may arise for her in said future. it won't be easy...my mother is a strong willed 51 year old mother of seven grandmother of 8 and she doesn't let anything (even a later diagnosis of ms and hearing loss entirely on her right side and having 2 children with asperegers, 1 alcoholic, and another with munchausens by proxy) keep her from doing her hardest to make it through each day.  tl;dr: my mom lived so can she.

t3_1y26fn-t3_1y26fn-cfh2a74	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	my great aunt never married or had children, but was always very kind and loving to her nieces and nephews. she loved her job and was proud of her career, and saved wisely so she was able to live very comfortably.  she traveled extensively, had lots of friends, and enjoyed an active social life well into her late eighties.    she was always very kind and was like another grandmother to me- she always went out with us whenever we took my grandmother out.  for mothers day, we always got 2 potted plants- one for my grandma, and one for my great aunt.  we would never take one out without the other.  it didn't matter that she never had children of her own- she had family that included her and took care of her.  she was kind and generous to the people around her throughout her life, and so even though my mom was not her daughter (nor biologically related, even...my mom was adopted), and i was not her granddaughter, she was always taken care of and didn't "die alone."    my great aunt was very independent and always chose to live on her own- and she had the finances to support herself in a very nice facility, in her own unit, with round-the-clock nursing care available.  my mom took her into our home for a few months to recover after she had a brain tumor removed...she wouldn't have done that with any other family member, but it wasn't even a question when it was her aunt. i managed her healthcare/paying bills/picking up groceries/etc. at her assisted living facility, about twice a week, when my mom moved to hong kong.  during the last couple of months of her life, i was there almost every day (she had dementia and was blind, so having a familiar voice was very reassuring to her).    her funeral was very very small- perhaps 15 people total.  (at 93 years old, she had outlived all of her friends and siblings.  only the family that called/wrote letters/visited occasionally (they lived far away, so i don't blame them for not visiting more) came to the funeral.  the rest didn't bother.  (but, the ones that never visited or called on christmas were the first ones calling up my mom about their inheritance checks, of course.)    i think it doesn't matter if you have kids or not, as long as you are a good and kind person throughout your life, and manage your finances well, you will be taken care of- whether it's your own kid, your sibling's kid, your sibling's kid's kid, or a friend or neighbor.

"depression" as used in the colloquial sounds something like this:  * man, my gramma died over the weekend, i'm so depressed.  * this weather is depressing.  * it's depressing living in a town like this.  clinical depression is a different beast entirely. though not exclusive to the above, its roots and expression vary significantly from the examples people typically provide. this leads to various problems and can exacerbate the condition for a suffering person. one of the reasons mental illness is stigmatized is due to differences in terminology.   as an example, let's say i called in to work and told them that i couldn't come that day because i had brain cancer and was in too much pain at that moment to be productive. now imagine that people in your workplace treated "cancer" the same way that many regard "depression":  * did you hear that sue didn't come in today because of her cancer? i mean when my dog died i had cancer for weeks but i still made it to work on time.  * lol, jim's got "cancer" again. i mean i have cancer, you have cancer. everyone has cancer from time to time but we all found it in ourselves to pull it together.   sounds bizarre, but this *is* the way many people refer to depression. it's possible for those who don't suffer from the clinical condition to sympathize with the clinically depressed, but impossible to empathize with them. in much the same way as i have had a bad headache but i've never had brain cancer. i can *imagine* what it *might* be like, but i really can't know.  clinical depression isn't necessarily feeling "sad" or "bad" or "suicidal". it is a mind-killing, soul-ripping despair that utterly destroys all hope, love, faith, purpose and contentment. it is self-perpetuating and feeds on itself. it cannot be cured with positive thinking or exercise or scented bath-salts... or with inspiring comic books. what's so terrible is that those things *do* help people experiencing the difficulties in life that we all face. for the clinically ill, this adds another dimension to the nightmare as they fail again and again to free themselves from what appear to be the typical slumps that accompany being a human being. telling the clinically depressed to "just keep going", or "imagine what might be" is the equivalent of telling someone with a broken leg to "walk it off" or telling a diabetic to "just produce more insulin".   clinical depression is an *illness*. the wounds it inflicts are grievous, but invisible to the eye. most importantly, it afflicts the part of ourselves responsible for how we perceive reality. you mentioned that your friend doesn't believe that a professional could help him. of course not! how could *anything* defeat what appears to be an insurmountable adversary? how can we instil hope in the hopeless? that's part of what makes depression so fucking tricky; we cannot think our way out of a prison made of thought.   i wish i had better advice on how best to help your friend. the simple truth is that if he is indeed clinically depressed, then he needs clinical treatment suited to address the cause of the depression. anti-depressants can be almost unbelievably effective, yet many refuse them without ever having taken them in the first place. "the side-effects aren't worth it", "they'll change who i am", "i'll be like a zombie" - these reason seem insane to a healthy person observing someone who is in such pain. it's like refusing to bandage a profusely bleeding wound because you might be allergic the wrapper the bandage came in. yet this thinking can seem perfectly reasonable to someone in the grips of the disease.  it's a good sign that he's still talking. past a certain point he may no longer see any purpose in conversation and seek to complete his isolation. he may find that company or interaction of any sort only makes the feelings more unbearable. this is an extremely dangerous place to occupy. in that space the despair becomes complete and eclipses the last of whatever tethers us to the world. when those last tendrils are severed, there is no longer any reason to exist.   but it doesn't have to end that way. there *are* treatments. there *is* hope. life *can* be better, unimaginably better. better than he ever knew that it could be. at some point there's nothing left to lose.   i hope there's something in what i've written that can aid you and your friend. i sincerely, **sincerely** hope that someone reading this can identify enough to seek help. if someone sees this who has felt this way, please listen to me: even if there's nothing that will help you, that nothing will change, that it's just the way things are... that isn't the truth. your mind is lying to you. things can be so, so much different then they are right now.  good luck everyone!
t3_20bvin-t3_20bvin-cg1pbb1	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i never met my grandfather on my father's side. he was named after his father, and my father was named after my grandfather, and i was named after my father. so i'm the 4th. (legally it's it iv, like roman numerals) my grandfather was so excited to meet me, his first grandson from his son named after him. he died from stomach cancer a month before i was born, so i never even met him in my infancy. my grandmother on my father's side i never met until i was twelve years old, briefly. then she passed away due to cancer a year later. my other grandfather on my mother's side i had "met" when i was two years old, then again when i was around thirteen. he passed away from brain cancer two years after that. my only remaining grandparent is my grandmother on my mother's side but i have never met her due to the act that she left my mother and my grandfather when my mother was an infant.
t3_49wd7y-t3_49wd7y-d0weiol	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i fainted in middle school. i was at the overhead doing a problem for the class. it was really easy, but i couldn't figure out the answer. very confused as to why i couldn't do it, the teacher asked if i was having trouble. i remember saying something affirmative, then him standing over me asking if i was ok. it took me a good 5 min to realize i was no longer standing, the side of my head really hurt, and that i had completely lost conciousness.  my back was in severe pain, and i just remember a girl telling me i was falling gracefully until the side of my head met the corner of the table.  i had to go to the nurse for a good while, because standard procedure is to make sure they cannot be blamed for anything.  i was pretty much still in shock and didn't think too much about the social impact it would have. not that i was all that popular anyway, my mind was occupied with concerns over my health, if it meant i had some brain cancer or tumor, and was going to die.  i took no time off from school; i tended to just not care after i realized it was just my brain defragging from the day and not to worry.  while i was made fun of occasionally, (kids brought it up every now and then when they wanted to call me out), more who knew about it were concerned and wondered about it because fainting in class is noteworthy, rather than wanting to label me as a loser because of it.  my advice is to not worry. don't marry yourself to this; this doesn't define who you are as a person. if you're forever "faint boy", then just shrug it off and be the coolest faint boy that banged that hot chick because she stopped caring about a little thing that happened to you.  don't let people use it as an insult, and they won't use it.

t3_2wrug3-t1_coud3n8-coy6ohp	brain_cancer	relevant	0.5065	a few things, mainly i just don't think it fits my personality. while i do like high acuity, i like it in the icu where i will be figuring out what is going on with the patient and caring for them day after day. i don't like that in the er if the patient is high acuity you just stabilize them and admit them to the micu, if they are non-critical but sick and interesting you just do a basic workup and admit them to internal medicine, and if they are non-emergent/not admit worthy but interesting you refer them to the internal medicine clinic. i feel like either way i will end up seeing these patients but i much prefer to see them as a medicine doc where i can work them up and follow them up.  and then all of the rest of the people that will never get sent to medicine? i just don't care. i don't like bones - there are a lot of bones. i think appendicitis and cholecystitis is okay but honestly you just call gen surg so after dx you do nothing. and finally, i don't like lacs or burns or women or children or psych. so...yeah, i'm def internal medicine.  i also think it depends what er you work in because i think my er sees a lot of booshii because so many of our patients are uninsured and don't have pcps so when they have anything they come to the er. examples below (from a post i made on another thread):  "help! my 2nd toenail turned dark 6 months after a pedicure." no.  "i was on my way home from work so i wanted my glucose checked." it's 118. and you're not diabetic. no.  "i have gerd and i feel like i am having worse gerd right now." no!!!  even "i have known brain cancer and known seizures and i just had a seizure but i am dnr and don't want any surg chemo or rads and have a meeting with palliative next week." why.  gwink, care to reply why you do like em? that would probably be helpful to this poster.

t3_1qzjmo-t1_cdi8r6m-cdiawlj	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7361	correct. by law most preventative care has to be covered, there has to be an out-of-pocket max (~$12k for families), and they have to accept everyone, even those with pre-existing conditions.   so, for healthy john q public, the only immediate benefit is that most preventative care is covered (at 100% i think?). and for sick sally it's good because she will no longer go bankrupt to pay for her meds and if she finds a different plan she likes more, she can switch because insurance companies can no longer discriminate against her because of her medical condition.  **the bottom line is this:**   we have a crisis in the country of people - working class and middle class - losing everything they own because they can't pay their medical bills. most people in those economic situations are one injury away (or were one injury away) from bankruptcy.   the aca largely fixes that because it used to be if i was diagnosed with say brain cancer (hey it happens) then i would not only have to pay my deductible but once the insurance company paid their "max amount" (there is word for this, can't think of it) for the year i'd be on the hook for 100% of the costs. then, once i'm already broke or near broke for covering whatever insurance didn't, the insurance company would drop me next year and i'd be unable to get another company to cover me because i had a pre-existing condition (brain cancer).  edit: so say i had was in a terrible accident and had $100k of medical bills in a year. under the aca, the most i'd pay would be my premium and $12k if i'm on a family plan.

t3_2tiqmd-t1_cnzqixm-cnzs3b3	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	&gt; should i suddenly have to explain to a social worker why i didn't bring her in with just the fever, and hope that person isn't tired and run down from other cases and doesn't make a knee jerk reaction to the situation?  you're right, there's no way every case can be checked, nor should they be. no parent should be assumed to have done something wrong unless proven otherwise.  lemme clarify what i mean. i said "if a parent doesn't seek medical treatment for a sick child and the child suffers for that" and "if the child suffered badly out of neglect". that doesn't mean every kid who's got appendicitis, or a parent didn't come in the first hour of symptoms needs to be checked.  it's the neglect part i'm concerned about, not the illness itself. hospitals get really sick kids every day. parents, like yourself, deal with countless moments of sickness with their kids without having to run to the er every single time (i used to get very frequent headaches as a kid, but nobody needed to check if i had brain cancer on that alone i guess).  lemme put it this way, if a kid had appendicitis symptoms, really terrible pain and the parent waited overnight not sure what the issue was, and then took to the doctor when noticing the kid's become even worse, that could be reasonable. no need for the doc to call social services on that.  but if the kid was in excruciating pain for like 3 days and the parents didn't seek out help, and then the appendix burst and the child suffers badly out of that... i know social services are stretched but i hope that family gets checked out at least.   or if the parent said "to heck with medicine, i'll treat it rubbing herbs on the abdomen" and the kid suffered for 3 days in pain and then the appendix burst.  i mean the suspicion should be arisen if a kid suffers and the doctor is not convinced by the parent's story. there has to be something odd in the scenario, something you wouldn't expect an average parent with no medical background would do. the doctor decides whether to call social worker.   but even then, it's just a check. the parents could explain themselves and the matter dropped.  &gt; however, if i have legitimate concerns, i'd rather have them addressed before a criminal/civil charge is needed.  of course, the doctor should be obligated in his professional duties to address your issues. i just mean in the emergency setting where time is not available then that may not be possible.  but a parent not happy with a doctor's lack of explanation in a regular pediatrician setting is well within his/her right to take their kid to a new doctor completely.  i surely wouldn't go to a doctor who doesn't answer my concerns and tells me to just obey without explanation.  &gt; thank you for your view points! i rather enjoy some friendly discussion!  yeah i enjoy the convo too, it's good seeing if my view holds when questioned.

t3_4h9q7e-t3_4h9q7e-d2padqd	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i didn't develop a sexual interest in other guys until i was 16, and that happened pretty much overnight. that was *very* disconcerting to me, not because i'd been raised to believe there was anything wrong with it, but because it was such an abrupt and incongruous thing for me. being bisexual, it was a lot like waking up to find someone had built an addition onto your house overnight, with no warning. not bad in and of itself, but very disturbing and confusing at first.  a lot of people have tried to convince me that i was "suppressing" before that, based on the dogma that sexual orientation is "set" for a person at birth, a "fact" i'm not really convinced of. even after wracking my brain at length, i've never been able to find any memory of any thought or feeling even hinting at that previously.  at first i though there was something seriously wrong with me, like i had brain cancer or something. if someone had suggested to me that i'd been abducted and had something implanted in my brain, or that i'd become suddenly possessed, i'd have been very prepared to consider it seriously at the time.  as it was, i told my folks that i wanted to be taken to a doctor, and why. their reaction would have been considered anticlimactic in the extreme, if i'd been seeking any sort of drama in the situation. as it was they mainly took an "it is what it is" approach to it, and expected me to do the same. my mother was somewhat inclined to make a bigger deal out of it than it was, but my dad thankfully put a damper on that. my dad largely considered my personal business to be *my* personal business by that point in my life, but my mother's always taken a somewhat different view of this. it's something we tolerate from her within limits, but my dad will reel her in a bit if she seems to be intent on being meddlesome.  as for "aftermath," there really wasn't much to speak of. there's just never been much discussion on the subject. the only thing they were insistent about was that i keep it to myself until i'd left for college, which turned out to have been very good advice for the most part. my mom has also asked that i *not* try explaining it to my maternal grandparents, who she feels wouldn't understand and don't need the stress of trying to. she knows them better than i do, obviously, so i consider her judgement better than mine on this.  my brother outright refused to believe it, and seriously thought that i was playing some sort of joke on our folks, until i literally put a boyfriend directly in front of him. he still doesn't really comprehend it, but he accepts it as one of those things he just has to accept whether he understands it or not. (he is not the sharpest tool in the shed, it's not the only thing he just has to be content with accepting without really being able to grasp.)  *grammar

t3_4x5ljx-t1_d6cpmk5-d6dij0g	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6654	completely agree. this book is incredible.  i had brain cancer a while ago and reading this was transformative/therapeutic.   the guy puts complex emotions on paper. he said things better than i ever could have. one of those rare moments of 'yes that's exactly how i feel', that you get from only the best books.  highly recommend checking out his article he did for the new york times too (came out before the book).  [how long have i got left?](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/opinion/sunday/how-long-have-i-got-left.html?_r=0)  not just for people who've dealt with mortality/death/illness. just a great way to take a minute to examine what makes a life worth living.

t3_1358su-t3_1358su-c717k5u	brain_cancer	relevant	0.8321	i was a sophomore at williams college last year. 23:45/11:45pm on wed., november 15, 2011 (almost a year ago to the day) i had a grand mal seizure while hanging out with friends. i don't recall the seizure, which was severe enough for my friends to call an ambulance. apparently while i was being loaded into the ambulance i gave them a peace sign. first thing i remember is panicking because i'm in a moving vehicle and had no recollection of how i got there or who the people with me were. i assumed i was being kidnapped because i was restrained.   anyway, i was given medicine and water when i got to the er. my friends weren't far behind (though it was around 12:30am) but i didn't see them for a while.  i had a ct scan at the er and it revealed a mass in my brain. i was shocked, but suspicious. i wasn't sure if they were sure, and somehow that reassured me. i called my parents and told them about the scan results, and that i was being rushed to the major hospital an hour away and that they should meet me there. on my way out of the er i saw my friends waiting in the lobby for me -- it was about 2:00am by then -- i didn't know they came at all, and seeing them there was monumental. my friends rule.   i got to the hospital in no time, and my parents were there soon after. i couldn't sleep, so i just stayed in bed and talked with my parents and other relatives who showed up over the day. that evening, i was told i would be having surgery the next day. i told my mom: "if these doctors think the mass needs to be removed, then being here in the hospital with surgery scheduled for the next day was maybe the best circumstance of all". i really trusted my doctors and learned a lot about neurology from them (before and since the surgery). that night i ate a bomber's burrito (i was in albany ny) and understood it might be my last meal. that night was difficult and nerve racking. but i remained positive and understood that it wasn't a gamble: this surgeon was incredibly skilled and actually had just operated on my sister's friend a month before and everything went smoothly. my family were barely keeping their wits about them.   i said goodbye to my relatives, and meant it. i went in to surgery and was put under. could have been an instant or a hundred years later, but i eventually came to. it was friday evening, only a handful of hours after surgery. immediately i recalled why i was i the hospital, and realized that i could remember, which was good! my sight was foggy from the drugs, but i recognized the haze as typical and didn't notice any visual artifacts from surgery. unfortunately the drugs also made me weepy, and i cried out for a nurse. my first request was to know where my mom was. my second was to get my phone to tell my friends i made it. i was told to quit bitching for a few minutes, though not in so few words, and they did give me an extra kick of morphine. before long i was with my family again, and had contacted my friends back at school. then i ate another bombers burrito, lest the last one truly be the last one.   i was in the hospital for a week altogether, but was recovering very well (especially with pain killers and muscle relaxers, which i took mostly to relieve tension in the muscle around my head where a brace had been screwed into my cranium to prevent any motion). the friends who saved my life came to visit me a few times over the next days. finally i was released. my best friend from home picked out a new bed for me with my father, and i was glad to be in my old home again, with my dogs and friends i hadn't seen in a while. i wished to be back at school a lot. i missed my friends but wouldn't know if i was healthy at all, let alone healthy enough to handle a curriculum that challenging.   two weeks after surgery, i celebrated thanksgiving very hard. i even had wine, my first drink after surgery. still no diagnosis.   a month after surgery, i hear that it was cancer after all. stage 2 astrocytoma. they got it all, and i would be healthy in no time. i suffered no brain damage from surgery, and was even feeling well enough to complete my courses from home.   tldr; didn't know i had brain cancer until i had a seizure, friends saved me, doctors fixed me, 100% healthy now!
t3_2arc3i-t3_2arc3i-cixzdp0	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	since there are a ton of different cancers, it's safe to assume that most experiences are different in a lot of ways but probably similar in some.   i have a good deal of experience with cancer i would think. i was diagnosed with brain cancer after two brain surgeries in 2011. i had to drop out of college for the surgeries and move back home. in 2013 my mother who had been taking care of me passed away suddenly from cancer. i had another brain surgery less than a year later in december 2013.   i also lost feeling and for some time the use of the left side of my body after my first surgery. i managed to walk again and learn how to use my arm and leg again through physio. the effects the treatments and surgeries have had on my body and mind have been pretty extensive so far but probably could have been worse considering the kind of surgeries i underwent.   if there's one thing i think cancer patients and survivors can probably agree on is that cancer is terrible and everyone should take as many measures as they can to avoid it for as long as possible.

t3_bjqo6-t3_bjqo6-c0n4vrr	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	i've never really had the imminent death experience that most other posters are mentioning - any time i've been in direct physical danger i've been too busy trying to get out of it to think about what's going to happen if i fail. or, possibly, i've just never come that close to instant death. on the other hand, i was diagnosed with brain cancer a few years ago.  at first no one knew exactly how bad it was going to be or what the prognosis was, but the statistics suggested i'd be lucky to be alive in 6-12 months. this gave me a completely new outlook on life, one that can be summed up with two words: fuck it. i found myself simply not caring about hassles and troubles. and i don't mean i had that 'don't sweat the small stuff' attitude either - i didn't sweat anything. i can remember looking at my asshole boss who was bitching about something and thinking to myself "i could just get up and walk out of here. why am i putting up with this?" then i found myself thinking "i could probably leap over this table and rip his throat out with my teeth right now. what would anyone do about about? odds are i'll be dead before i even go to trial." there was a tremendously exhilarating (and terrifying) sense of freedom from consequences. the social contract started to simply break down for me.  one event that sticks in my memory was of being driven around by my girlfriend in my convertible (couldn't drive myself because of seizures) and seeing some other guy road rage at us in the next car over. he may or may not have been high on something (and we may have cut him off or something too - i have no idea) but man, he was pissed at us. he was screaming something pretty incoherent and i was just looking at him with an expression of casual interest. he started yelling at me that i better stop looking at him or he'd "slap the rest of your hair of and do the same for your bitch wife too" (my head was shaved due to recent brain surgery). a year earlier i would have ignored him or possibly felt a little worried about being in an open car in case he got out of his car and wanted to start something. instead, i was just thinking that if he came over i would do my level best to kill him, just because i could. i remember thinking i could probably heave him off this overpass and into the interstate traffic below us and probably even get away with it by claiming i couldn't remember any of it later. this isn't classic internet tough guy trolling either: nothing happened, i probably would have been hurt fairly badly if he'd attacked us and i wasn't posturing or egging him on or anything. i was just very aware that i didn't have much life left and if he wanted to tackle me i would have no problems doing my best to take him out with me. it was a very strange, very neutral and disjointed feeling.  for a few months i waited for diagnoses, prognoses and result of treatment and idly thought about how i would go about picking targets for elimination if i got a confirmation that i had only a few months left to live. instead, i found i had a fairly rare tumor that wasn't as aggressive as expected and i responded really well to treatment. that was almost three years ago and i lost that sense of detachment long ago. i don't really miss it, but i did kind of like the sense of freedom it brought me. as it is, i still have a much lower threshold for hassles; i don't get mad or anything, i'm just well aware that i don't have to put up with them if i don't want to. i'm much more aware of my own mortality now.      tl;dr: no sudden death story, just a cancer diagnoses that made me stop caring about the consequences of anything for a year or so.

t3_1ln64g-t3_1ln64g-cc100n0	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	my grandma was the most beautiful woman in the world and i'm not saying that just because she was related to me. she won ms. copacabana two years in a row, despite her parents telling her to quit and become a religious woman and settle with a religious man. my grandma and grandpa met when they were filling out paperwork to immigrate. my grandpa was from uruguay and my grandma was from brazil, my great grandma cursed my grandpa with nine lives, but that's a story for later. my grandma started smoking at the age of fourteen, it was her husbands fault that the habit got worse instead of better. he didn't support her, he treated her like a slave and made her do everything. the cooking, the cleaning, the taking care of the kids.  fast forward a few years and my siblings and cousins are born. we all loved our grandmother very much, my cousins started calling her ma! she was a keen, up to date, fashionably savvy, and beautiful grandmother. then, she started to deteriorate. songs she had known her whole life were suddenly difficult to sing, getting dressed and remember where her shoes and skirts were was a challenge. something was off and when she came to visit for succos (a jewish holiday that celebrates the harvest season) we noticed something was very wrong. she shared a room with me and on the first day of our holiday, we were waiting for her to go to synagogue, i went into the bedroom to see what was taking so long and she wasn't dressed. "grandma what's wrong?" i asked, she looked at me surprised and said, "i just need to put my clothes on and put on a little makeup!" i told her okay and sat on the bed to wait for her to finish getting ready, she stood in front of her suitcase, suddenly unsure of herself. "what's wrong grandma? do you remember where you put your shabbos clothes?" at this point i was worried, she was walking in circles for another twenty minutes before i got up and picked an outfit out for her and helped her with her makeup. the next day the same thing happened and we took her to the hospital. she went kicking and screaming, not wanting to go. my grandma, grandpa, dad, and i all went to the hospital and she was checked in within a few minutes. the took a brain mri and came back, telling us that there were three tumors on her brain. i cried and cried for hours, i came home and cried and texted my best friend (even though it was a holiday and she wouldn't answer). i went the next day to visit my grandma in the hospital, she was very flustered of course and had no idea that she had three tumors on her brain, because every time we told her she forgot. they were going to do a biopsy to see if it was cancerous. the results came back positive. they couldn't operate on it because it was too big and so they decided on a round of chemo. my dad took my grandma to every specialist in the country, my parents called every doctor they could find. no one wanted to touch the tumors. my dad flew from our home in st.louis to miami almost every week for five months. about four months into chemo, my grandma was put into hospice. i cried every day, praying to g-d to heal my grandmother, even though i know it was futile, at this point it would have been less painful for her to pass. i knew she was pain, she was in mental and physical pain, but she didn't know she was going to die and i was thankful that she kept trying to pull through. everyday she lasted was a miracle and my hope had been lifted, maybe she would make it, she had beaten cancer before, maybe she could do it one more time! my grandma passed away the same month as my dad's birthday, february 19th 2012. the day my father and his siblings had gone home for the sabbath was the day she passed, she had waited for them to go home so that they would not see her die. my grandmother was the most beautiful woman in the world, she was with me one moment and the next she was gone. what family means to me is not something that can be described; my grandma, she taught me to value the little things and to never submit to anyone's will. she taught me that no matter where life takes you or no matter what situation you are in, you can always change it for the better. sorry for the wall of text by the way, i didn't mean for it to end up this long. i just started writing and it sort of all just poured out...

t3_wbkxp-t1_c5ce708-c5cnq30	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6738	why not both? because its not true. there's actually studies that show that bpds are considerably more receptive to others emotions than others and more capable of being compassionate and understanding due to the extreme emotions they feel themselves. the one exception is abandonment triggers which is thought to temporarily reduce their capacity for empathy. also were talking about bpd here not npd here. and like i said bpd has an 86% remission rate, you can't say that most bpds do not recover. you need to stop treating the cluster b diagnoses as being equivalent. sure they share a few of the same symptoms, but they are all distinctly different, and that's why we treat them as separate diagnoses. also you need to stop using fictional characters as examples, perhaps glenn close did have classic bpd symptoms but there was probably something else there. never in my life have i seen a real case of bpd that severe that wasn't co-morbid with both aspd and a manic episode. also i really care any less about your theories on bpd, if they are valid and eventually become universally accepted and change the way bpd is thought of, then so be it. but for right now bpd is defined the way it is defined and your theories will not affect my diagnosis. i do accept my diagnosis, my actions and their consequences, and i am being treated. i do not accept the connotation and stigma that comes with it, for years people have treated me like a rabid animal after i tell them my diagnosis even if i've known them my whole life. they just hear bpd all of a sudden i'm like a serial killer or something. if i told people i get angry sometimes because i have brain cancer i highly doubt that people would still treat me like that. i didn't choose to have bpd, it is an illness that is out of my control, just like cancer would be if i had it. unfortunately people don't seem to understand that, they don't realize i have as little control over having extreme emotions and impulses as i would have over sprouting cancer cells. yes, i can learn to not act on these impulses, and i am learning, but it takes time and can be just as difficult to treat as any other illness out there. also i never said a bpd cant harm their kid, i think they're equally capable and likely of doing so as any other human being. a bpd diagnosis is not synonymous with child abuser. and deep down i know its right? being labeled as an abusive monster is right? i'm clingy, i get angry, i hurt myself, i do drugs. i must deserve a label that will immediately destroy my social life and alienate me from "mentally healthy" people including my own family. yeah, seems about right to me.

t3_u8sla-t1_c4taaz7-c4takcs	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6625	i have a stage iii oligodendroglioma. from what i've read they're very slow growing and not known to be metastatic (spread). when i was diagnosed my doctor told me i had the "best" kind due to its nature. i still laugh about that. i'm a sucker for irony.  i did a bunch of research and i found it to be too depressing. i just let my doctor do his thing. i have an mri every 3 months and he tells me what it's doing (so far: nothing. which is good.)  my love life was already fairly complicated before all this happened. i was seeing someone for a few months but we broke up about a 6 weeks after this happened (we're still friends though).  a week before i was rekindling something with my high school sweetheart (we were on and off for 7 years almost), we had gone out to see the grinch musical (her favorite dr suess character) in december 2010. we were just hanging out and being friends at the time. it seemed like we were going to get back together (as had been our habit/pattern over the time we had known each other).   the day before my seizure i got back together with an ex-girlfriend, we'll call her d.  d and i dated from july 2009 to may 2010, and we were on and off after she cheated on me in february 2010 (after we had a fight), we stayed together but were constantly fighting most of our relationship anyway. it was toxic to say the least).  during this time i was experience mood swings and was anxious. i want to contribute part of this to the fact that i had brain tumor in my left frontal lobe i didn't know about and i couldn't really compensate for an issue i didn't know anything about.  when i woke from my coma i had lost my memory of the previous few weeks, my last really clear memory was january 1st, and i did a polar bear dip on new years day. this particular ex, we had gone out a few times as well before and i was falling in love with her again, wanting to forgive and all that. i woke up and found out she had been contacting my family and friends and i had no idea why. i freaked out and told her to leave me alone.   it took about 4 months for my memory to fully comeback and we had actually gotten back together two days before my seizure. i got back with my on again/off again and that didn't last long before i finally made the decision to break the cycle of breaking up and getting back together, because i honestly didn't see us getting married. we're still really good friends. d and i don't talk anymore.   i've dated a few girls since, and i don't like mentioning it but sometimes the conversation just kind of goes that way "so why did you take 2 years off school instead of just 1?" is a pretty good segway into that.  but to be honest, i have no idea how to bring people into this crazy situation. dating was difficult before and it seems like its even harder now. or maybe its the exact same. i don't know.  one girl i dated i met while i was actually cycling on temodar while i was out for a friend's birthday, it was getting time for me to take my meds and i had to excuse myself. she asked why and it was pretty awkward.  i really shouldn't have been dating anyone while i was going through treatment, to be quite honest.   i've had good reactions to the "i have incurable brain cancer" line, as in they still continue to act like girls and be wishy-washy and play games. i try to avoid girls like that now anyway. focusing more on quality of a person. dating is all about meeting the "right" girl. so it's pretty easy to filter through all the wrong ones.  **but** i suppose this is just part of what i'm doing to be a better person. i was a jerk and didn't live to my fullest, now i've been giving the opportunity to be the person i want to be, so that's what i'm doing. i approach things with patience and understanding, and give people enough space to still be themselves. i think my problem has just been meeting people who aren't in a place to settle down and date seriously, while that is the way i approach potential girlfriends. i don't want flings and i want commitment. it's not easy.

t3_s3nh5-t3_s3nh5-c4b4g05	brain_cancer	relevant	0.6568	when i was your age, i had similar experiences of hypersexuality (which has settled into a dominant homosexuality).   your peers are not nice people, if middle-school has not changed much in the past decade. my advice to you is to be direct in conversation about your sexuality if someone confronts you about it. not being sure of your sexuality is uncomfortable, and it's awful to be the topic of gossip, at a middle school nonetheless. however, if you can communicate that you might be gay, that you are experiencing sexuality in new ways (as all pubescent people do), and that the only change has been the public release of this statement about your sexuality.   i also stress that sorrow, personal stress and bullying are common among many people in secondary education. these aspects of life do not fade as you grow older. on the contrary, you have the opportunity and insight granted by this bizarre and disrespectful leak of information to gain information about society that your peers may never quite understand. whenever i feel frustrated, whether for academic, personal, social or reasons, i turn to myself and realize that in the worst of all possible worlds, i would not be in any control of my situation, and that the control i find (through relaxation, introspection) empowers me not only to accept the state of reality as it is, but to make the changes i can make to establish a more comfortable environment for myself and those around me. when i had brain cancer last year, i faced many uncertainties and had no control over the outcome of my illness and surgery (fortunately, it was a good one. i'm very healthy now), i realized that what i could do was comfort my family and my friends.   i think your case is very different from my experience last november, but in a way, you have a similar opportunity. you may not have control over your sexuality, and you may not even know what it is yet, but you do have the entire remainder of your personality, your past, your body, your mind, and these can all be tools to help show that you are comfortable without an absolute answer. if your peers see you behaving comfortably (not necessarily 'normally'), they will back down. they probably haven't done much in the realm of introspection, and this little head-start could bring you very far.  i really hope you can see the light

t3_4ug8vw-t1_d5pnlbn-d5r2hq8	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	there are two key metrics we should use when evaluating any treatment: efficacy and risk.  chiropractic's efficacy,  specifically its long term efficacy when compared to bed rest or ibuprofen, is sketchy because it's not a real medicine and isn't regulated by actual medical science, where you would have to prove in repeated random controlled, blind, studies, that it was statistically more effective than bed rest and placebo.  however, if efficacy was the only problem then you would only be wasting your money.  the real problem with chiropractors is risk. if i said to you "i can fix your back, but there is a 1 in 1000 chance i'll give you brain damage" what would you choose?  two examples:  let's say i'm selling a headache pill and it works every time, but 1% of the people who take it end up dying a week later, well then that headache pill clearly isn't worth the risk.  what if i have a pill that cures brain cancer 99% of the time, but 1% of the people that take it end up dying within the week as a result of taking the pill. well, in light of the severity of the cancer, the efficacy of the treatment, and the risk involved, it is probably worth taking. (i believe this would still be controversial)  chiropractic is like a pill for back ache that has short term benefits 30% of the time, and 1% of the time results in serious long term disability. but the real problem is that because chiropractic is not a proper medical science, they are not doing the studies they would have to do in order to prove that i'm not just making those numbers up... (my numbers are about as scientifically accurate as theirs though).  the studies the chiropractic industry do do are not done properly, and meta analysis of the chiropractic studies shows that it is very seldom any better than taking an ibuprofen and going to bed, and sometimes can be very very very bad... we just don't know how bad.

t3_3itu5x-t3_3itu5x-cujos2q	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	"i'm sorry naomi, but you have cancer"  said doctor wrightman. "cancer?  but thats just not possible?"  a smile forming on my lips.  "it's just not possible"  i said staring intently upon his face looking for a break in his grim visage.  "you're really serious aren't you?"  the smiling giving way to a slightly troubled look.  "well it can't be that bad can it?  i mean i feel great."    wrightman shifted uneasily in his chair.  never in all his 74 years had he seen anything like this.  naomi, 26 years old, had suffered from several problems from birth,  she was constantly running to ophthalmologists, immunologists, dermatologists and more.  just last week she had all but crawled out of the doctors office due to the onset of allergy season.  today however she was a radically different person.  her usually red irritated eyes shone their deep, natural green, her large bubble glasses rested in the breast pocket of her shirt, red hair flowing in locks down her back where it usually stayed in a messy ponytail to keep it from the trail of snot and mucus usually adorning her freckle strewn face.  the skin on her arms and legs that was usually adorned with scratches and scabs was completely clear and clean, a feat which wrightman would have bet his own life was impossible after seeing her just 10 days ago when he sent away her samples for testing for a full range of disease.  the small framed girl had changed, she seemed to have put on a great deal of muscle and seems aglow with life, a stark contrast to her usually ill-inclined demeanor.    wrightman straightened up in his chair, realizing the long pause he had taken after her appearance had caught him off guard.  "yes, it appears to be very severe."  not quite knowing how to phrase what he had to say.  "what is it i have then?  lung cancer?  brain cancer?  blood cancer?"  wrightman seemed to squirm in his chair like a slug having salt poured over its whole body, he seemed to lose mass like a pufferfish deflating "all of them" he muttered, barely audible.  i snorted in disbelief "i've known you for a long time doctor, but this is hardly the time for jokes" knowing very well he would never lie about such a thing, however, i hoped that possibly some sort of madness had gripped him so i said it anyway.  "i'm sorry but i don't even know if i could go through all the tests that came back positive in any reasonable amount of time.  you have over 75 different kinds of cancer affecting every part of your body.  seeing how advanced it is they estimate you have about 3 months to live, maybe less.  tears began making headway down my face as i collapsed to the ground.  my whole life i've been sick and now this time there was no last minute procedure, no pills or diet changes.  i was going to die.  i collapsed to the ground and cried, it was all i could do.    i slowly made my way out onto the street, my mind a blur with talk of treatments and prognosis.  it was all a half-hearted attempt at making me feel better about dying, i was sure of that. "i at least hope i keep feeling this good for the last few months, i'd never felt normal but this is pretty close i bet".  in the last few weeks after the test were taken i had been recovering from a rather insidious cold, vomiting cramps, and being sore all over.  after that subsided though i noticed my vision becoming blurry, but as i was going through the drawers looking for the number of my ophthalmologist my heavy glasses slipped off my ears and into the drawer of pens and cluttered paper, in that moment i'd seen clearer that i had in years.  i ran to the window and stared outside, i could see the leaves on the trees!  not just the green blobs that i usually did.  it didn't stop there i noticed i needed less and less allergy medication until i just stopped using it completely.  where i usually needed both arms straining to lift a sack of flour, i could now easily lift it with one hand.  i guess none of it mattered now though, i was dying right when things were turning around, how typical.    as i rounded the corner onto willam cresent i heard a blood curdling scream.  i was frozen, a woman ran up to me and yelled almost incomprehensibly.  my brother!  please you need to help him he got stung by a bee and he is allergic! i don't know how to use him epi-pen please!  can you help?  i had allergies all my life, this was one instance where being a sickly hag was going to be useful.  "yes, i can help, where is he." i asked "over this way!" she yelled with panic on her face as she grabbed me by the hand and led me down an alley.  it never dawned on me until the metal pipe struck me in the back of the head that she could be lying to me.  my brain seemed to go numb and i felt a thousand miles away.  all i could hear was the woman's shrill laugh as she poked fun at me with her accomplice for being so "gullible".  in that moments i knew anger.  it was all i could feel, it was more real to me that the feeling of the cold concrete on my face and the warm blood on my neck.  my whole life i had been beaten down my genetics, disease, and reactions of my body.  these however were people, bad people, even if i couldn't do much i was gonna fight.  in that second i knew i had to fight.  so i lashed out with a blind punch at where i heard the stupid guffaw of the man that had hit me.  a warmth enveloping my hand as it connected with his stomach and pure energy fused with him.  he flew through the air about 5 feet but when he reached the wall on the opposite side of the alley there was nothing but dust to hit the was as he dissolved and was whisked away in the wind.  i stared at my hands in disbelief for a moment, confused but no longer afraid, before fixing my gaze on the woman.  edit - spelling

t3_4zu504-t3_4zu504-d6zvy49	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	hi thanks for so many of you being helpful on here but i am sure some of you have noticed someone calling me a 'leech'. this is hurtful and i do believe everyone is able to have their own thoughts and opinions. obviously not moving is a big deal and posting private information of sorts is not easy. i have personally had radiation to my brain twice here in australia which has lead me to get behind in the educational system. i am a female and i have suffered from a condition called endometriosis and adenomyosis. now for any of you that understand this condition its as painful as stage 4 cancer and believe me suffering with it is has impacted my life a great deal. as has my radiation treatment. my neurosurgeon told me at 16 it would be easier if i had brain cancer to treat me. one of the reasons i am looking to move is because my government is australia only contributes $10 per person for endometriosis. this in many ways shows me my government does not believe in equality. now i am not looking to move to germany and have kids unfortunately with brain it is not something i can do. australia has made the fertility industry private and conditions like endometriosis are something that this private industry abuses. i am not going to go into detail. as per my post i am awaiting a payout from a car accident i suffered from now resulting in thoracic outlet syndrome along with arthritis and a couple of other minor shoulder injuries. i have also gone through a domestically violent relationship whilst going through this. now i am not asking for sympathy. but i do believe that i am should be allowed an education. i am a high achieving student when i am able to have my health at least 80 %. before i do consider moving i will be under surgery to treat my thoracic outlet syndrome. as for the condition with my brain there is no solution as yet. in regards to endometriosis and adenomyosis there is still known cure. but i do have some sinus issues i will be having sorted out. the reason i am looking at  tiny house is to with my moral and also my health i don't want or need huge amounts of space. also being called a leech for things beyond my control is upsetting. i didn't cause any of my health issues. yes i choose a bad relationship that i regret. but it has gone through the courts here and that has been dealt with 18 months ago. i don't see why people have an issue when someone is doing the best they can with what they were given. all i want is to be able to make a difference in the world. i don't see how i can do this when i see so much inequality in my own country. when my values are represented somewhere else. and lastly if anyone posts on here against aaron swartz and what he believed in.you will be reported and blocked, no exceptions. he was a creator of reddit and someone who i admire deeply because of the changes he made in todays world. he like several others on the internet believe that those in poverty (which i am in at this moment waiting for this legal issue and surgery to be done) or dealing with inequality should not be denied access to education. so anyone waiting to tell me i have right to move and become part of a different society don't bother with your posts. you are stopping the world and our culture from changing and making this the planet we all need it to be!

t3_2rv4af-t3_2rv4af-cnjqiw0	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	**tl;dr: i was a minor who didn't want to have chemotherapy, but it saved my life.**  this is quite the difficult situation because at which point does the government have any right to say what a person does or doesn't do to their own body. i am conflicted as i hold two views that contradict each other.  i was diagnosed with brain cancer almost twenty years ago. i was a minor and my family made the choice for me that chemotherapy (along with surgeries) were the best option for me. as a teen i objected to having these chemicals in my body, especially after the first week when the side effects came into play. if you had asked me at any time during those two years if i would rather have it all stop and just live out whatever life i had left i would have given the same answer as this young woman. i'd also be dead. every treatment i had only hardened my view, i felt as though i was being tortured. i had no joy in life, and i honestly wanted to die just to avoid future pain and sickness.  looking back at it these years later i don't understand my own logic. if i were to be sick again i hope that i would now do anything and everything possible to stay alive, but i won't know unless it happens.  i honestly don't think she is mature enough to understand the choice she and her family are making. yes chemo is literally going to poison her body and she will hate every waking moment of it, but she has a chance to live a full life afterwards (85% right?). what solidifies things for me in this instance is how much better the drugs are. there are less side effects (both short and long term) than even five years ago.  i'd rather that she live to be an old fart like myself and be able to look back at the horrible times than to lose her life because she and or her guardians aren't capable of making an informed decision. but at the same time i support a person's right to die. like i said, i am conflicted.

t3_4u7y62-t3_4u7y62-d5o86bx	brain_cancer	relevant	0.6567	since we're on the topic of mental health, i wanted to share a quick anecdote of my own. in brief:  * my dad died when i was 15.  * i was made homeless for a short while due to the home life failing after my dad died.  * i lived in a youth refuge * i had a few friends go through major trauma (suicide, rape, assault). i myself was assaulted and attempted suicide. * by the time i was in my 20s i had (undiagnosed) anxiety disorder / depression. it was untreated. * eventually i became agoraphobic. i never left the house. disconnected the phone except to order home delivered food. i didn't check my mail. i didn't go to university or (casual) work.  * it was only when centrelink cut me off for non-attendence that shit really hit the fan and i was seen at a mental health hospital. this would have been ~2008  by 2013 things had turned around:  * i had made a full mental health recover and was working full time. * i actually dropped some work hours to part time, and returned to university.  * i also needed to lose weight due to obesity, so i booked in for a gastric sleeve operation for dec 2014 and started to diet. * and finally i had my sleep issues (narcolepy / sleep aponea) now treated.  and then in nov 2014 i was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. life expectancy 2-5 years.  what's really surprising about all this is, when people talk to me about my cancer, the often say *"you're handling this very well."* what they don't realise is that the my terminal cancer is not the most stressful part of my life. it was that anxiety / depression. that should tell people more about mental health than anything else. so let me repeat it.  **tl;dr my anxiety disorder / depression was more stressful than my terminal cancer is.**   don't get me wrong. learning you're going to die in (probably) your 30s sucks major balls as well. but on my metric it's about 6/10 maybe 7/10 on a bad day. my depression, at it's worst, was 10/10. this is why people commit suicide. it's unbearable.

(other guys are not surrogate women as far as i'm concerned. if i'm attracted to another dude it's because of who *he* is, and i sure as hell wouldn't want him to be otherwise.)

t3_38tdnd-t3_38tdnd-crxwx1k	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.5063	one of my high school classmates, who was absolutely the sweetest, kindest girl i have ever met, died of brain cancer my junior year. she had been dealing with tumors in her brain since she was a little girl and had, up to that point, led a pretty normal life. then, one day she just... stopped coming to school. nobody knew exactly why, but it was pretty painfully obvious.  she passed some weeks later and almost my entire class (just over one hundred students) attended her funeral, where one of our teachers conducted the service. it was one of the most heart-wrenching experiences of my life.  i still wish i had taken the time to get to know her better instead being a stupid fucking teenager.  i know right now you're somewhere as beautiful as you were, morgan. we'll never forget you.

t3_48lytp-t1_d0kvv0k-d0kwzqk	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	yeah, i smoked every day for about five years but quit at age 23 because i was a totally paranoid, panic-attack controlled recluse. every time i would pass someone in the street i would think they were about to attack me. i would avoid people like the plague and i constantly thought i had brain cancer or some prion disease.   i didn't know if the weed addiction caused the anxiety or the anxiety caused the weed addiction. but after i quit i realize i'm still anxious but not to the borderline psychotic level i was before. i think it's like any drug: you're in pain so you take oxy, then after three years of daily oxy use you're in the same amount of pain normally but in even more pain when you're not on oxy.
t3_29gh20-t1_ciktvws-cil5tly	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	believe it or not, i actually became illiterate for most intents and purposes as a teenager.   i can read signs, reddit posts, facebook posts, advice columns, short articles, multiple choice tests, the tv guide, facebook chats, short essays, stuff like that.   but reading novels, plays, instruction manuals, textbooks, etc. is practically out of the question. it takes me many, many days and is very hard and frustrating. i tried reading the novel *dracula*, for instance, and it took me many hours just to read 3 pages. i also often read a paragraph or a page without actually understanding a single thing about it. i will read the words without comprehending them. this especially happens with old-timey language and long sentences but it happens with modern language and short sentences, too. i can't even read children's books anymore. i recently read two chapters of harry potter and was thrilled. it took me a very long time and i had to take adderall- but i managed it! :d  my ability to read long stuff slowly deteriorated starting in high school and came to an utter standstill when i was college-age. i still can't explain it. at first i believed i had brain cancer or early alzheimer's but my doctors ruled those out. they still haven't found an explanation.
t3_sp1go-t3_sp1go-c4fw9hx	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	a few years ago, my 75ish year old grandmother was going about her business as usual while my family and i were on vacation in mexico. she was suppose to go meat up with a friend, but that day, our gate refused to open,and she couldn't leave the house. as she got within arm's distance of her phone so she could inform her friend she couldn't go, she suffered a stroke, collapsed, and was almost completely paralyzed. almost immediately, her friend called, and when my grandma picked up, she only responded in gibberish. her friend called 911, and she received medical assistance within 30minuets. she made a full recovery, and proceeded to run a 5k race 8 days later. had the gate opened, she would have had the stroke while driving. had she not been within arms distance of the phone, she wouldn't have been found for days. had her friend hot called when she did, my grandma could have suffered brain damage. had my grandma fallen on the ceramic plate she dropped, she could have gotten seriously cut, but she missed all of the pieces. basically, my grandma is a stroke surviving, 2 time cancer surviving, ex marine badass. now, she is 82, and is still kicking ass and taking names.

t3_xdyes-t3_xdyes-c5lpbuk	brain_cancer	relevant	0.6818	i have one that affected me and one that affected another.  first, how i affected my grandma.  i was a kid sitting in her lap having a book read to me.  i got up and quickly turned and accidentally elbowed her in the breast.  she cried out and it bruised and i felt really bad for hurting my grandma.  i didn't know, but the bruise lasted for weeks.  she finally got it checked out and they found breast cancer.  it was early enough that they could treat it.  i didn't really realize the impact until many years later as i didn't really know what cancer was.  second, how a random xray tech saved my life.  i was 15 and i was having xrays done before a routine tonsil removal and nasal scraping (i had a layer of skin that kept me from being able to breathe well through my nose).  the xray tech came in and talked to me a little before i saw the doctor.  the pre-surgery appointment was ending and the xray tech came back in and said he saw something that he just had to mention.  there was a tiny(1cm) little bottom of a circle at the top of the xray.  it just stood out to him.  he talked my family into looking more into it and it turned out to be an arachnoid cyst growing between my brain and skull.  it was there since birth and it had kind of deteriorated that part of my skull to the point where it was extremely thin and could crack/break with very little impact.  i had to have immediate brain surgery to remove it.  now 15 years later i have two beautiful daughters and an amazing wife and a huge scar running atop my head from ear to ear to remind me of how short life can be.
t3_3n9vad-t3_3n9vad-cvnh8mk	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i was diagnosed with stage iiia grade 3 triple negative breast cancer earlier this year, and i just turned 30. i went through tests, biopsies, and i am currently still going through really aggressive chemo treatments. i got told at the start of august that it had progressed to stage iv, spread into my lymph system and that i'm looking at around 6 months left at best, so this christmas will be my last. i had ignored the signs at first, out of fear mostly. i think back now and wonder if i had seen to it earlier i might have a better chance now.  i've been playing the game since 1.0 alpha access, and for a long time it kept me sane to focus on the game and keep my head in check. my friends in game stood by me, but its been really hard on them. then the time came to start my treatment. unfortunately i had complications with my initial chemotherapy. allergies caused my skin to rupture with boils and i ended up with septicemia, and the resulting fever caused seizures, a coma, and my heart to stop. i was dead for several minutes before they brought me back, and that left me with brain damage that affected my co-ordination, motor skills and my ability to speak properly. playing the game during recovery was difficult, but the focus was helping my brain heal and reconnect the pathways it had lost. i'm still not fantastic and some damage is permanent, and unfortunately it forced me to have to give up raiding, but the game and the people i've met on cerberus saved me from losing all hope.  the following chemotherapy left me with severe neuropathy in my hands. it makes my hands send constant pain signals to my brain even though i'm not injured. this is effectively temporary until a few months after chemo stops, but it won't wear off before my time is up. because of this i'm unable to play the game at all, or even do much of anything. it saddens me to have to leave my friends behind. they've been the backbone of my life since i began playing, but circumstances have forced me to have to let my sub run out and i try and keep in contact with them as much as i can. i won't get to meet any of them in person like i had originally planned (my raid group is closer to a family than just a simple group of gamers) but right now i'm focusing on trying to make it into the new year and celebrate with them online if i do.  why am i saying all of this? story time i suppose, and to help awareness. but mostly to say that before i told anyone, i used to go along and beat this fate every time i knew it was up. i can't beat the fate myself anymore, so i had to say something to say i'm happy that people still are.  get yourselves checked. don't be like me. don't be ignorant, or stubborn, or embarrassed; just get yourself checked or it might be too late.
t3_2vu729-t1_col4ucu-colttx6	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6635	dude, i had a friend in high school who told me she had brain cancer and i actually felt bad for her and fell for the story. after graduation she made it seem like she had surgery and everything, telling everyone she was in a hospital in a state far away and stuff. i came to find out a week ago that she was actually in a psychiatric facility for some kind of personality disorder and she's been lying to garner sympathy for no reason. and the worst part is, my mom was just diagnosed with breast cancer and is going through a lot, so to hear someone lying about going through surgery and chemo and stuff for attention really pisses me off because they don't know how awful it is. and, when i told her my mom had cancer, she just said "that sucks" and proceeded to say how she was just diagnosed with depression and anorexia the day before and verbally attacked me claiming that it was all my fault because i had "low self esteem" and it rubbed off on her causing anorexia and in effect, depression. needless to say, she is no longer my friend.(sorry for the rant)
t3_1jvspl-t1_cbjgawz-cbjlmqe	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i know perfectly well what visceral means. my question is totally legit. you don't think people be should be "celebrating" something that is, what i would amount to, an issue of free speech because of your emotional connection to the content.  i have to wonder, would you have had the same reaction if it was about brain cancer and the bracelets said "i love braaaaains" - in order to pick up on the humor of zombies while "raising awareness" (i put "raising awareness" in quotations because that is the stated intent of the bracelets, but i don't know that i believe it is a legitimate  purpose for the campaign).  i understand where they are coming from with the campaign, i don't think it is successful in what they want it to accomplish, but i am not offended by it. boobies is meant to be a silly word, it is clearly not meant to demean or sexualize breast cancer. there are babies onesies with the exact same phrase on them.   granted breast cancer is something that i have always been aware of in my family as my grandmother was afflicted with it twice in her lifetime, once before i was born, and then again in my early twenties when it eventually spread and took her life. i have a specific "cancer" policy supplemental insurance plan because i am aware of what could run in my family.  the campaign is clearly meant to make something that is tragic easier to talk about with young people. it seems immature, because it is. it seems unsuccessful, because it is. but you're inferring intent that isn't there.
t3_3tgd29-t3_3tgd29-cx5y7e5	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i'm not a doctor, but have studied sleep extensively.  it sounds to me like your circadian rhythm is off. your brain does not know when to synthesize and create melatonin. melatonin is a hormone that does amazing things: it makes us sleepy, and it fights cancer, among other things.  150 years ago it would be dark long before 2am, and our brain would juice up the melatonin. now we have man-made lighting, and it throws off a bunch of us. the ama recently linked light with restrained melatonin production - and have linked that with increased cancer risk. breast and prostate cancers, for example. greatest risks:  bright light and light waves in the blue spectrum  a couple of quick thoughts: 1) how dark is your room?  2) how bright is it that last hour or two before going to sleep? 3) you might try different lights, avoiding blue spectrum lights. 4) an hour or two before turning out the lights wear orange- or amber-tinted glasses. they will block blue spectrum lighting, which otherwise messes with circadian rhythms. another tip: try running a fan in your room. do not point it at you, but use it to circulate the air and to make white noise. works for me.  best o' luck!

t3_1otvov-t3_1otvov-ccvqmkv	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6703	this is a terrible story which gave me lots of feels (mostly about hurting his "parents"), however, my husband's first wife died of metastatic breast cancer and it wasn't like this at all. hers was only in her organs but she still wasted away, went into a coma-like state and stayed there for a week before she died.    i understand that all cases are different but if she had brain cancer, it seems unlikely she was coherent up to the day before she died.   obviously, i can't know this, my evidence is anecdotal but these things are progressive, your body wears down slowly until you die so reasonable brain function (enough to talk and text) one day and then dead the next doesn't really make sense. unless she had an aneurism but the doctors predicted her death which means they could see what would occur based on the current progress of her body shutting down.   anybody else have experience with cancer death and how it works? i'd be interested to hear more cases. and to believe this is fake and people like that stepmom don't exist.
t3_3g8bt1-t3_3g8bt1-ctw5vx3	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i was being shouted at. eyes snapped open, the blinds north of my sights indicated it wasn't even daybreak. my father loomed overhead.   "get up!" he growled, sucking air through his teeth with true jamaican disapproval. he stormed out the pale taupe doorway and a glance at the bedside clock revealed it was 5:23 am. in high school i awoke at 4:45 am. i rolled my eyes and groaned upon finding out my brain had decided to grant me cruel dream lucidity. i shut my eyes tightly -- this usually would awaken me, but on occasion failed, and tonight was one of those times. fine, let's fly then. i jumped off the saggy mattress. bounced several times. the scuffed wood boards whined under my trampolining.  achieving a little air time wasn't normally this hard.  cursing the stubbornness of this scenario i wandered out to the kitchen to find the agenda my father forced me to keep. dad was making our lunches. "where's mom?" i asked while flipping open the book.  apparently the date was monday october 4th, 2004.   dad gave me a funny look. "she's at her study, remember? she won't be back till saturday." study? my innards churned. i remember her telling me about the allergy studies -- those she hated most --, where all the participants were seated in a room with vents and the researchers would pump the room full of allergens to test the effectiveness of the antihistamines. the drugs would suck. a week was a bit long for that though, so it must have been some other drug. one that required lots of blood draws.  the bathroom door whipped open and steam spilled out. jo glided out of the bathroom towards her bedroom. josephine...she was short, her head was proportionally bigger to her body than i was used to. she was 9. "hey," she said vacantly in passing. i raced past her to the bathroom and wiped away the mirror's condensation with my bare forearm. i was nearly 14 according to that date. my hair was short, i had hardly starting growing into my boobs, and still had annoying upper lip eczema with a light mustache i hadn't yet waxed. this was the most "conscious" i'd ever been in a dream. usually time wasn't this linear. i was horrified at how real this felt.   and if this was real... that meant we weren't supposed to know about our illegitimate little sister yet. grace had to be 3 and a half. i didn't remember when dad broke the news; all i remember was that we were on the ttc and it was sunny outside. probably wasn't happening until next summer. then her mother would die from breast cancer a year after that, her body buried in the philippines, far from where her daughter would be able to visit. a $100k inheritance would be waiting for her at 18, but it was useless in this moment. this moment...  in this moment, i zonked out, reeling from the shock. grabbed a towel and took a quick shower. breakfast was fruit and a bagel with melted cheese on top. jo went upstairs to practice piano, and i followed to "study".  reality pelted me over and over like a torrent of hail. this was no dream. talking to even trusted individuals would land me at [cam-h](http://www.camh.ca). and while their staff was certainly lovely, i wasn't supposed to end up there for insanity, just mere suicidal ideation. maybe, with my knowledge of the future, it didn't have to happen that way. but i would still have to figure out how to handle dad's emotional and verbal abuse, as well as help shape a better jo. jo, who bullied others in middle school because of our dad's horribly misguided love. jo, who chilled out to gorillaz and green day and would start cutting herself as the pain became unbearable. jo, who would come to hate me five years later while i had her restrained on the floor in front of the police, preventing her from leaving this shithole of a home because i was so brainwashed by my father.  not to mention my mother: she loved to travel. dad would laugh at her when she'd suggest becoming a travel agent. she would lose her office job soon due to cutbacks and settle with the night shift at zellers. she wouldn't leave my father for another six years.  that would only happen once she'd suggest to grace that she could bathe herself without my father's assistance at age nine, and dad would scream at her. my mother would leave for a shelter at jo's urging. dad would take out his anger on jo, choking her with a belt. i wouldn't be there to stop it as i'd be away at university.   what i wouldn't have given to have my fiance close to me at this moment. we weren't to meet for another five years, nor to be engaged for another seven (i would avoid botching the proposal this time). at least i could avoid wasting time in that online relationship. he was a sweet southern california boy raised by his grandmother, but we were to be emotionally incompatible.    if this dream was to be cruel, this time i could dominate it.  my father would not come to live vicariously through me. i would not allow him to show me off as a prize.   so, at 14, i would find a part-time job at the nofrills near my school, to save up in order to move out at 16, and somehow figure out the legal logistics of taking jo with me, or becoming an emancipated minor. my father would be appalled at my rebellion, but i'd cut contact with him. after all, i wouldn't have my first cell phone yet.  i would learn how to program, starting with python, then moving on to c, javascript, ruby -- whatever i could manage. i'd become proficient at linux, too. i would pester my future calculus teacher for copies of the grade 12 notes and a textbook, as my math courses would be the downfall of me in first year physics at waterloo.  i would in the meantime become the difficult child, deflecting the attention from my sister and suddenly telling off my father for his behaviour. he would be surprised and angered, since i would have normally stood quietly every time he berated me. i would insist that we need family counselling and he would refuse. he couldn't hit me. i knew krav maga and was 70 pounds lighter.   i'd see a doctor, because even though depression and borderline personality disorder were now preventable, i'd need some prozac or zoloft to manage. dad would not let me see a doctor; he'd insist nothing was wrong, that it was all in my head. until i'd gain freedom from him, i would practice my martial arts and meditation to keep calm. as tempting as it would be to hit up the stoners in the class to soothe the anxiety, i'd take up cannabis consumption in university, just like the first time through.   i couldn't rush my mother to leave, but i would encourage the pursuit of her passions. she would at least see sooner that dad was no good for her. maybe she would join me in my mythical apartment and actually start saving up for retirement as well as a vacation fund.  i would still play the flute and piano with all my heart. i wouldn't develop a crush on my band teacher, because i would know what would happen if i told him. i would still try my hardest to get into the waterloo orchestra come first year university and probably still not make it, with eighteen flutes competing for 2 spots, but that would be okay.  fuck running for school president in grade 12. i'd still happily do the morning announcements in grade 9 though, and would warn orion that his continual viking themed tirades, while awesome, would waste too much time in the mornings and cause a ban in student announcements for three years. as president, i would have had the ban lifted.   oh who am i kidding, he'd still get us banned anyway, and it would be totally worth it.   but aside from those extracurriculars, i would dedicate every ounce of my being to becoming a programmer, to not being afraid of mathematics. i embraced math, but it would take me longer to learn than others. i would apply to waterloo for co-op computer science instead of failing physics, hopefully riding in on scholarships and osap. i would make myself a special fund just to invest in google and tesla stock later. i would also buy a sewing machine and sew on the side for cash.   then in january of 2009, i would hopefully meet the love of my life. i would cringe at him all over again: that scrawny, awkward white boy from st. catharines with brown curly hair and black framed glasses that would break in two years. he would not have showered for two days because he would have been at school the night before helping our mutual friends with linear algebra. at the computer science club code party, i would teach him to play piano. he'd introduce me to ytmnd. i would pretend i know nothing about homestar runner just to laugh all over again. and with a little luck, he would still escort me back to my dorm in the dead of howling winter, and i would offer him a cup of tea (this time, my tea cabinet would be properly stocked, and the milk wouldn't be expired)!  maybe we wouldn't fall in love in two days, but more conventionally, with dates, conversations about math-games-concerts-dr. horrible's sing-along blog, and listening to the mountain goats while falling asleep. i'd be financially independent: waterloo cs co-op students often made upwards of $4k per month during their 4-month internships. i would not suggest my boyfriend work at amazon in seattle, because all the broken dev tools would crush him. maybe we'd jointly go to redmond to do co-ops at microsoft instead, because seattle was still a lovely city.  at 24, i will have graduated with a degree in computer science. i'd have a stable salary with benefits. and the investments would make the lives of my fiance and me comfortable. i'd work towards buying my mother a completely paid off house, and would fund josephine's education. i would provide a safe space for grace, and buy her a 3ds so we could play pokemon together.  i would finally be caught up to where i last was before that october morning, shouted awake.  thank you, cosmos, for what you've done to me. at age 14, i am an unstoppable force.  edit: changed names and other small details
t3_26vz3i-t3_26vz3i-chv4d4s	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7575	hi, here's me:   invasive lobular breast cancer, stage 2 (micro mets in the sentinel node) chemo:taxotere, cytoxin, double mastectomy with reconstruction, 7 weeks radiation, conventional oncologist and two private 'integrative' doctors who specialize in eastern medicine and monitor my metabolic and vitamin counts regularly. on a slew of supplements tailored to me. dont waste your time guessing and buying crap, hire a serious md who specializes in cancer nutrition. it's not as expensive as you think (my private docs are $75 an hour)  something that might make you feel better about chemo:   rgcc labs in greece can perform ctc (cancer tumor cell) and csc (cancer stem cell) counts in your blood by capturing and culturing for the best chemo drug to kill your cancer. they can also test the best natural substances to help you make other decisions about diet and alternative therapies. this test was crucial for me because i hated shooting in the dark. these tests will also identify the cancer or multiple cancers that are circulating (this test cannot find tumors/cancer activity that has not shed into your blood stream yet, nor can it identify brain or lymphatic activity, there are other tests for some of those as well as traditional imaging).  counts above 5 are considered poor prognosis - mine was initially a 14. after surgery 12, after chemo 8. i'm continuing vitamin c treatments as directed by the results of this test as it came in as the most sensitive to this natural substance so the saga continues. i'd like to quickly point out i'm considered ned (no evidence of disease)...but until my ctcs are under 5 and traditional markers are normal - i don't think so.    the full cost of cell count, pathology if you will, chemo and natural substance sensitivity through rgcc was $2700 usa. cell search based in the us can only perform the cell count and for that they charge 3k, but i understand some private doctors have arrangements for $600 and only very recently do some insurers cover this marker test performed by them. johnson and johnson acquired the patent from rgcc which cell search bases their process on so for me i'm happy to get more information and pay less by sending my blood overseas with rgcc.   you only need the sensitivity test performed once so the ongoing monitoring of cell counts through rgcc are only $800 after the cost of a blood draw ($125, which you have to search or call their tx based office to find a doctor registered with them to do the draw in your area).  some argue the chemo/substance testing is useless because the results are of course observed in vitro (outside the body in a petri dish) but it's the best god damn thing we've got to guide us individually instead of being treated based on a group and statistics (i have lobular breast cancer and they are placed in the ductal bc group so this didn't jive with me). live tissue testing, good luck, it's expensive and even if you talk your surgeon into doing it there's high risk the thing dies in transit or prep and that costs you as well.   if anyone knows more about the status of ctcs as markers in this county and the companies providing them, i'd really like to know more - and if my information is incorrect i do welcome feedback. i'm just a stay at home mom who was diagnosed in sept of last year who is doing the best research i can to save my life. i didn't want to do any of these conventional treatments either but using cam (complimentary alternative medicine) alongside convention, it really helps avoid other drugs and can help you maintain a pulse on what's happening to you.  i hope this helps.  also look into medical grade cannibus, aspirin, copper therapy and beta blockers...   read and advocate for yourself. your doctors are busy.  **edit: wow! i got down voted? tldr? you don't agree with the tests? this is a year of my life running full speed in research to save it. figured i might save someone a lot of time. i'll lurk from now on.**

(i personally suspect you just copy-pasted from [this here blog](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/cancer-funding-does-it-add-up/), which doesn't have a link either - awfully familiar looking table.)  i couldn't find a breakdown of funding per case or per death on the nci website.  i did find [here](http://obf.cancer.gov/financial/attachments/06factbk.pdf) (pdf) fy06 numbers for new cases, deaths, and total funding.  from there i arrived at some different numbers.  if anyone wants to check my math, feel free!  type -- funding (mill) -- new cases -- funding/case -- deaths -- %mortality -- funding/death  brain &amp; central nervous system  -- 130.3 -- 20,500 -- $6356 -- 12,740 -- 62.1% -- $10228  breast cancer -- 584.7 -- 180,510 -- $3239 -- 40,910 -- 22.7% -- $14268  cervical cancer -- 83.3 -- 11,150 -- $7471 -- 3,670 -- 32.9% -- $22708  hodgkins disease -- 20.9 -- 8,190 -- $2552 -- 1,070 --13.1% -- $19481  leukemia -- 223.5 -- 44,240 -- $5052 -- 21,790 -- 49.3% -- $10247   liver cancer -- 62.7 -- 19,160 -- $3272 --16,780 -- 87.6%  -- $3735  lung cancer -- 242.9 --213,380 -- $1138  -- 160,390  -- 75.2% -- $1513  melanoma --108.0 -- 59,940 -- $1802 -- 8,110 -- 13.5% -- $13348  multiple myeloma -- 30.3 -- 19,900 -- $1523 -- 10,790 -- 54.2% -- $2810  non hodgkin's lymphoma -- 114.1 -- 63,190 -- $1806 -- 18,660 -- 29.5% -- $6122  ovarian cancer -- 95.1 -- 22,430 -- $4240 -- 15,280 -- 68.1% -- $6226  pancreatic cancer --74.2 --37,170 -- $1996 -- 33,370 -- 89.8% -- $2223  prostate cancer -- 293.2 -- 218,890 -- $1339 -- 27,050 -- 12.4% -- $10798  stomach cancer -- 11.5 -- 21,260 -- $541 -- 11,210 -- 52.7% -- $1027  uterine cancer -- 19.4 -- 39,080 -- $496 -- 7,400 --18.9% -- $2624  first off, i got slightly different numbers from those in the blog entry listed above.  i'm interested to know if she did the math there, or if she in her turn pulled that table (or pieced it together) from another source.  anyway, op.  for one thing, breast cancer is *not* the highest funded cancer listed here - per case or per death.  you were incorrect about that.  furthermore, assuming you have a prostate, are you comfortable with the fact that prostate cancer receives far more funding than a host of other, deadlier cancers (including ovarian and uterine)?  do you think there is a real justification for it, or a non-sexist reason for it?  that is, do you see how asinine your flippant little inquiry is?  why should we feel responsible for some perceived gap in funding because we have breasts?  *i know my list is not the prettiest thing to look at, but fuck it, i'm going to dance class.
t3_2ax5rc-t3_2ax5rc-cj0b9r0	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i am a breast cancer researcher and a few years ago, my dad sent me an email asking if this treatment could help a friend with advanced, inoperable brain cancer.   the treatment was making a wound, putting a legume paste in it and wrapping it in cabbage leaves. it was supposed to "detox" the blood and there was some magic compound in the legumes that attacked the cancer. the worst part was that the crazy doctor who came up with it had a fancy website complete with comprehensive video explaining the "science" behind it &amp; that he had discovered core concepts of molecular biology (which he hasn't).    the worst and most shocking to me was how the video melded partially correct biological information with quackery to make it sound scientifically plausible. it was at that moment that i vowed to try to communicate to the public about science better to try and increase scientific literacy and stopping some of these crazy stories from holding substance.   cancer is horrible enough without people being misled and misinformed.
t3_1q4sl5-t3_1q4sl5-cd9n5lv	brain_cancer	relevant	0.7393	so my mom is the youngest of 13, herself and her closest oldest sister being twins. there are only 3 sisters left (now) my favorite aunt and uncle happened to also be my god parents. they were very important to me. one year my ex navy, steel mill working uncle was diagnosed with cancer. that was very hard news for me to take, but treatment did it's work and he beat cancer. then he beat it another 6 times. one holiday when i was 18, my parents bought me a case of guinness which i was enjoying with laughter and great conversation with my god parents, as the other family milled about. my other aunt now has about two bottles of wine in her. she sees me drinking and calls me an alcoholic, my god mother right she was referencing her and her husband, a verbal fight breaks out with my god mother saying andy (her husband) had beat cancer and deserves to enjoy a couple of beers. my god parents go out to the garage, where i go out to calm the situation, i saw my god father, the man i considered a second father to me, balling his eyes out. i couldn't help my self and joined in on tears with them. my uncle took a turn for the worse a couple years later lying in a hospice with brain cancer, coughing up blood. i refused to go see him even once, even though he requested to see me. he passed, violently, and the last time i saw him was at his funeral, where his kids from his first marriage showed up (they aren't very close with our family) his sons look exactly like him, it was a shock to a lot of us seeing our deceased family member almost in the flesh again. my one aunt finally makes her prima donna appearance. waddling her fat ass in showy, sequined fat people closes, loudly bitching to anyone near by how horrible her day is going. first the nail salon screwed up her nails, then the wrong color, then she got stuck in traffic, and lastly detoured her 400$ white coach purse in dirt. all before saying her condolences to her stone faced sister, who is fighting back the tears of seeing her husband of 35 years dead. i calmly let go of my god mother's hand, stand up, walk over to my prima donna aunt and said "you're having the worst day of your life?! your sister is burying her husband today and all you can think about is you? i pick up a glass of red wine and dumped it on her white 400$ purse, and looked her in the eye, and told her " now you have something to bitch about, don't talk to me again, you're dead to me"  my god mother clung to my arm, dug her frail hands into mine and cried into my shoulder.  she discovered a year later she had breast cancer while helping her husband fight off his. she fought hard and long, the cancer finally took her from me 3 months ago. i went and saw her in the hospital before she passed, and i got to kiss her, and i begged with her to kick cancers ass so she can see me propose and get married to my gf, who she loved. ( my aunt hated my ex of 7 years and threatened her life after we broke up and stole about 10k in money over the years, she grew close to my current gf always talking to her and telling her embarrassing stores of me)  she died holding my dad's hand, her best friend, my dad who had never cried in his life, even at his fathers funeral, couldn't console himself. at her memorial, the same cunt of an aunt threw a temper tantrum cause my family didn't play ave maria, stopping the ceremony, silencing the attenders, and embarrassing herself entirely, red in the face, fat ankles stomping the ground.   we played ave maria as my parents and i who were sitting in the front row, got up to walk down the isle to the exit. i smiled and flicked off my aunt to the song of ave maria.  i know it's not as inappropriate ad some of your stories, but to me that is the biggest offence i've ever witnessed, and i hate my aunt to this day
t3_40axat-t1_cytf2rv-cyth78e	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	eh, good point, but here's a counter point:  you have a shell fish allergy and keep an epipen in your (locked) bag. suddenly, you go into anaphylaxis because you didn't know that that pasta had crab in it. your friend grabs your bag, only to find that he can't get inside! now, you're fumbling with the lock: 9... (the age you had your first pet, jack, the jack russell terrier) 4... (the number of letters in jack's name) and... what was the last number? you can't remember because your swelling esophagus is preventing you from drawing enough breath, and now your brain is becoming deprived of oxygen.  your entire life begins to flash before your eyes; your fifth birthday party where you accidentally pissef your pants and cried in front of ask your friends; your first date with that girl cheryl who have you the clap; and that 5k you ran in support of breast cancer awareness after your mom got breast cancer... wait! that was it! 1! that's the next number! the number of breasts your mom lost! you realize in that moment how odd it was to use that for your combination lock... but it does you no good. it's to late. at this point you are too weak and delusional to enter the last number. as you fade away, you hear your friend calling your babe in the distance. your final regret—that your dying thought is about your mom's left tit—gradually evaporates, and your existence fades to nothingness.  all because you didn't use a key ring!

t3_tlfpd-t1_c4nmlok-c4nngic	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.5029	this sounds all to familiar, i lost my mum after a 6 year battle with breast cancer in 2008, i was 18.  she had 2 brain tumours, kidney, liver and stomach tumours.  i am one of the few people who know that feel...and my god does it suck.  what i will say is this, take care of your family.  this may sound cliche but they really need you.  grief is one of those things without a time limit, it hit me after two years!    it seems really tough to begin with but it gets a hell of a lot easier.  do this, do not stop talking about her, just because she isn't around anymore doesn't mean she has to be out of your life.  the more you reminisce about happier times, the sadder you will feel, but in a few years you will look back and remember she's better off where she is now, out of pain and free from sickness.   peace out bro, stay strong.
t3_4xokfe-t1_d6hu8gj-d6hvi9w	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	do you know cannabinoids (the things that make up cannabis) are naturally occurring in breast milk? they encourage baby to eat. soothe baby. and make them happy and sleepy. sound like anything else we know?  did you know cannabis induce neurogenesis? thats the killing off of unhealthy nerve and the birthing of new ones. cannabis creates new pathways in the brain. it doesn't destroy them (unless already dead or dying in which case it will replace the ones it takes).  i'm not advocating passing a j to your kids. but i see no reason why a sick child shouldn't be allowed to use marijuana in a medical capacity with doctor supervision. there are some pretty amazing stories out there of cannabis making epileptic kids seizure free. and non-verbal autistic kids speaking after 1-2 doses of cannabis. saving kids dying of cancer in days to weeks.   humans and mammals have an endocannabinoid system. there are receptors all throughout our bodies. cb1 and cb2 receptors work like a lock and key with cannabinoids. cb1 is mostly in the brain and mostly triggered by thc. which is why we get high. cb2 receptors are mostly in the major organs and are better activated by cbn.

t3_26owml-t1_cht51kl-chtwmmo	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6474	thanks! i'm not sure what the out-of-pocket cost will be for the drug they want to put me on but when i asked how much it costs without coverage the neurologist told me $17,000 per year which i couldn't afford. i'm waiting for another appointment to discuss medication options and will hopefully get a clearer idea of what my portion will be. living healthy is crucial no matter what, like you say, and you're right that we can't endlessly try out different therapies. it's going to be a gamble. i'm just risk-adverse by nature :) so i try to research things to death and get lots of feedback from people who have been through it.  there are risks to the medications though... slightly increased risk of breast cancer with copaxone for example... so it's not totally risk free. plus they don't really know what it might do to a person say 30 yrs down the road, and it seems iffy as to whether they provide any protection against disability. that's the stuff that keeps me on the fence about whether to take it and deal with potential side effects, but so far i've had a very mild disease course with only 1 episode of optic neuritis and nothing else for symptoms in 2 years, but i do have a ton of brain lesions with one new one in the last year, so i have to think that at some point relapses will become a problem.
t3_1qir07-t3_1qir07-cde38xe	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i don't know the type of breast cancer your mom has, but when i was diagnosed, my cancer was all over the place including the chest wall and skin. i also had bone and brain mets, massive amounts of skin mets and for some reason the pleural cavity, but that never went anywhere and 42 of 42 positive nodes.  i'm 16+ years out and while i've had some recurrences, i'm fine.  i have a rare breast cancer where by definition, skin and chest wall infiltration are expected. it's highly unusual and very unlikely your mom has this. a rapid swelling is associated with this cancer, not a lump as well as a tell-tale rash, and your mom apparently doesn't have either of those symptoms.  once you have an answer about the type, staging and treatment plan, it gets much easier.
t3_1x6aum-t3_1x6aum-cf8mn38	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6632	hello and thanks for doing this.  i have been trying to come to grips with the recent suicide of my mother in november (she was 67). she was undergoing treatment for stage 4 breast cancer and dealing with my dad's stage 4 prostate cancer as well. add to that an increasingly obvious lack of short-term memory, and it became too overwhelming to her.   anyways, right before her death, we finally got her in to see a professional who interviewed her and got her an mri to see if there was anything awry. after her death, the doctor said that there was nothing abnormal in the scan and he had no idea what was wrong. her brain had shrunk a little, but said that was a normal part of the aging process. i'm confused, because it was pretty obvious over several years that she was getting worse and worse. in the beginning, she would forget simple but insignificant things. at the end, she literally would forget major things and whole conversations that had happened just hours prior. just in case it matters, she was a lifelong smoker (light) with no other major health issues or family history of dementia. the memory issues began before her cancer treatments.  i guess my questions would be (1) what if anything can i suspect to be the cause of what happened to her and (2) would there be anything i'd need to worry about and/or pay attention to for my own brain and memory? i saw firsthand what it did to her, and it scares me to think of it happening to me.

t3_45oln9-t3_45oln9-czzidcy	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.5826	so here is my view.  i lost my wife of 20 years to breast cancer a year ago.  we had a great life and three young kids who she loved beyond words.  my daughter and i were with her when she took her last breath after a day of horrific pain. had it been a matter of will she would still be here with us. the fact of the matter is that when cancer is in your liver and your brain and your lungs your will to live cannot change things.  enjoy the life you have and the time you have with those you love for as long as you can but it cheapens your loved one if you imply they "lost a battle" or "couldn't fight anymore".
t3_10rdtd-t1_c6fyyml-c6g3jyo	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	my grandma has made me ultra wary of any and all hospitals. she was diagnosed at 40 with breast cancer, and she beat it. fast forward 30 years and we discover it has grown back, but in her hip. now, my grandma was the type of woman who still wore bikinis (and rocked them) and did swan dives from her diving board to impress her grand kids. we live in florida, and she lived in a particularly woodsy area, so had to be active to clean her house and shine her brass every day or mildew set in.   back to the story though, she went to the hospital complaining of severe hip pain, no appetite, and dizziness. they scanned her hip and found cancer, but stopped looking and just figured that was that. days later, when the doctor asked her what year it was she answered "new york city" and still they blamed her loopiness on her pain meds. she was vomiting and still not eating. a couple weeks later she died of cancer that had grown rapidly from a tiny speck in her brain and stomach. if a test had been done to rule out those possibilities, i may still have my grandma today. maybe not, as cancer is a horrible bitch and maybe it wasn't in her cards to beat it twice, but knowing that they didn't even give her the chance to fight because tests are expensive makes me fear hospitals. :/

t3_2eyiv8-t3_2eyiv8-ck4bnoy	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i think placing a possible insult to plato made this post seem presumptuous, but fwiw there is very little refuting of plato from what i see.  it seems like it's more about how essentialism is applied in places where it should not be, i.e. things that defy complete mathematical definition.  this is much like how one can agree with marx without agreeing with many communist revolutionaries.  dawkins makes a good case for the idea that essentialism is a cognitive shortcut is situations in which we have placed categories on things which ultimately defy categorization.  gender is an excellent example.  is it defined by chromosomes?  prenatal conditions?  is it defined by the sexually dimorphic parts of the brain which are often inverted in transgender people?  how about a social construct?  it's all of those things.  as a result, one has to make a working definition for *every* context in which it is used.  "male" and "female" when talking about biology, sociology, and psychology are all completely distinct, and happen to have the same word, even though they obviously overlap when we sit on the top of the bell curve.  but that's not always the case, as any genderqueer person will tell you.  given that context is not a countable feature, being exact can be unbearably cumbersome, and one will eventually end up asking a question with no apparent relation to the situation.  for example, how often have you been asked about your y chromosome at a bar?  when someone asks me "are you a boy or a girl?"  i often sigh and shrug, because to answer properly i would need to respond with several questions of my own.  (i will use gender simply for a consistent analogy which i can competently describe, so please excuse my bias)  at the same time, we need to cut corners, make assumptions, and "round" to discrete benchmarks because our language is limited without the reasoning specified by dawkins.  it is reasonable for most intents and purposes, and assuming he is completely against it is black and white.  but one still needs to be aware of the assumptions being made.  the assumptions we make in any given situation vastly outweigh the information that is concretely discussed.  if we allow these "snapshots" of reality to exist in scientific language and in law without making reasonable qualifications, the effects can compound over time, and our quality of life can be diminished.  for example, we don't think much about the gender marker on our insurance forms often.  but what happens when a transgender woman needs treatment for breast cancer (yes, this is possible with hrt) and they are denied coverage because the gender marker is defined by chromosomes, while breast cancer risk is generally determined by hormones? (this is hypothetical, so pardon me if i am mistaken) suddenly, a harmless assumption is threatening someone's life.  in the case of race, the box you check on a form can affect your employment prospects, college acceptance rates, and many more.  maybe removing essentialism is not the best word.  being judicious in where and when we apply it is a different story.  it's ironic that dawkins "rounded" to the idea of removing it entirely for rhetorical reasons, though.  but much like myself, he is not a philosopher.

t3_4ecal9-t3_4ecal9-d1zdm4x	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7386	depending on the type of cancer there can be cognitive deficits following treatment including memory, attentions, executive function etc. personality can be affected. there is also a change in perspective that happens following treatment that takes some people awhile to get through depending on severity.   i've lived through both breast cancer and leukemia. i had a bone marrow transplant 3 years ago which required total body radiation including radiation to my brain. i also had intrathecal chemo more times than i can recall. this is where they do a lumbar puncture and inject chemo directly into your cerebral spinal fluid in order to treat your brain directly. i've been diagnosed with cognitive deficits.   sometimes you need to see a psychologist and psychiatrist to try to learn how to be normal again. getting better mentally is a long process and it seems no one thinks to address mental effects until long after treatment.   my hospital provides programs for patients and caregivers. you could look there for support for yourself and your mom.
t3_1xl232-t1_cfcgrqc-cfchf12	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	my mother in law recently had brain tumors removed, she had breast cancer via the lymph nodes removed six months ago. they couldn't find any more cancer in her.  but last wednesday she went for a checkup after some head aches and spewing in the car. thursday they did more tests, friday she was flown 250km to the better brain doctors in the stae. saturday she went under the knife, and today, tuesday, she's up and about, with a walker.  probably not going to cost her a damn thing either besides the medication. got to love science and medicare.
t3_1oit9c-t3_1oit9c-ccscv5j	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	ok i had breast cancer 2006, was in treatment for about 10 months.  i had four surgeries, 6 chemo treatments and 30 radiation treatments.  that said i have been in remission since then.  the cancer itself doesn't hurt, didn't hurt me.  the surgeries, poking, blood draws, shots constant dr. visits were a drag.  i was sick from chemo everything as describe below.  and chemo brain is true and i've read that some symptoms of chemo can last a decade.  i still have some issues with eyesight, memory, digestion.  i gained weight...steroids were part of my treatment and haven't lost it all.  radiation was bad too.  like my boob was constantly sunburned.  emotionally i was all over the place. they give you drugs to offset the effects of these treatments, but the drugs themselves mess with you.  i was addicted i'm sure.  i have come through it.  but it never leaves you, you'll see it everywhere, your neighbor, friend even my dog got cancer.  now i have a 1st cousin going through treatment.  family history started with me i guess.  the thing is don't let it define you.  don't let people only see your cancer....that's the worst feeling for me.  people don't know what to say so they say stupid things......and forget that there's a person there dealing with this.   sadly those descriptions below are exactly correct.  i remember the dr. asking if i had animals.  asked if they drank from the toilet... he told me to flush the toilet 3-4 times after use as the residue left there from my urine would kill my dog if she drank from the toilet..and they gave it to me straight.  that blew my mind.
t3_3ih9kq-t3_3ih9kq-culop8u	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	judging by your title, you've probably already read [this review by e. russo on phytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effects and cannabis synergy in general](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3165946/) but for those who haven't or just want some condensed info, here goes:   &amp;nbsp;  &gt; support derives from studies in which cannabis extracts demonstrated effects two to four times greater than thc (carlini et al ., 1974); unidentified thc antagonists and synergists were claimed (fairbairn and pickens, 1981), anti- convulsant activity was observed beyond the cannabinoid fraction (wilkinson et al ., 2003), and extracts of thc and cbd modulated effects in hippocampal neurones distinctly from pure compounds (ryan et al ., 2006)    &amp;nbsp;    &gt; **are cannabis terpenoids actually relevant to the effects of cannabis?**    terpenoid components in concentrations above 0.05% are considered of pharmacological interest (adams and taylor, 2010). animal studies are certainly supportive (buch- bauer et al ., 1993). mice exposed to terpenoid odours inhaled from ambient air for 1 h demonstrated profound effects on activity levels, suggesting a direct pharmacological effect on the brain, even at extremely low serum concentrations (examples: linalool with 73% reduction in motility at 4.22 ng·ml , pinene 13.77% increase at trace concentration, terpineol 45% reduction at 4.7 ng·ml) these levels are comparable to those of thc measured in humans receiving cannabis extracts yielding therapeutic effects in pain, or symptoms of multiple sclerosis in various randomized con- trolled trials (rcts) (russo, 2006; huestis, 2007).   &amp;nbsp;    **conclusion:** &amp;nbsp;  &gt; considered ensemble, the preceding body of information supports the concept that selective breeding of cannabis chemotypes rich in ameliorative phytocannabinoid and ter- penoid content offer complementary pharmacological activi- ties that may strengthen and broaden clinical applications and improve the therapeutic index of cannabis extracts containing thc, or other base phytocannabinoids. psychopharmacologi- cal and dermatological indications show the greatest promise.    loose translation: cannabis with high amounts of different cannabinoids and terpenes are more valuable than the sum of their effects would suggest. with proper selective breeding, we can make whole-plant cannabinoid medicine more 'efficient' and more widely applicable.   &amp;nbsp;  gratuitous info on some phytocannabinoids, as found in the same review:     &amp;nbsp; &gt;**thc**  is the most common phytocannabinoid in cannabis drug chemotypes, and is produced in the plant via an allele co-dominant with cbd (de meijer et al ., 2003). thc is a partial agonist at cb 1 and cannabinoid receptor 2 (cb 2 ) analogous to aea, and underlying many of its activities as a psychoactive agent, analgesic, muscle relaxant and antispas- modic (pacher et al ., 2006). additionally, it is a bronchodila- tor  (williams et al.,  1976),  neuroprotective  antioxidant (hampson et al ., 1998), antipruritic agent in cholestatic jaundice  (neff et al .,  2002)  and  has  20  times  the  anti- inflammatory  power  of  aspirin  and  twice  that  of hydrocortisone (evans, 1991).    &amp;nbsp;  &gt;**cbd** is the most common phytocannabinoid in fibre (hemp) plants, and second most prevalent in some drug chemotypes. it has proven extremely versatile pharmacologi- cally (table 1) (pertwee, 2004; mechoulam et al ., 2007), displaying the unusual ability to antagonize cb 1 at a low nm level in the presence of thc, despite having little binding affinity (thomas et al ., 2007), and supporting its modulatory effect on thc-associated adverse events such as anxiety, tachycardia, hunger and sedation in rats and humans (nicholson et al ., 2004; murillo-rodriguez et al ., 2006; russo and guy, 2006). cbd is an analgesic (costa et al ., 2007), is a neuroprotective antioxidant more potent than ascorbate or tocopherol (hampson et al ., 1998),   &amp;nbsp;  &gt; **cbc** was inactive on adenylate cyclase inhibi- tion (howlett, 1987), but showed activity in the mouse can- nabinoid tetrad, but only at 100 mg·kg- 1 , and at a fraction of thc activity, via a non-cb 1 , non-cb 2 mechanism (delong et al ., 2010). more pertinent are anti-inflammatory (wirth et al ., 1980) and analgesic activity (davis and hatoum, 1983), its ability to reduce thc intoxication in mice (hatoum et al ., 1981), antibiotic and antifungal effects (elsohly et al ., 1982), and observed cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines (ligresti et al ., 2006)      &amp;nbsp;  &gt;**cbg** , the parent phytocannabinoid compound, has a relatively weak partial agonistic effect at cb 1 (k i 440 nm) and cb 2 (k i 337 nm) (gauson et al ., 2007). older work supports gamma aminobutyric acid (gaba) uptake inhibition greater than thc or cbd (banerjee et al ., 1975) that could suggest muscle relaxant properties. analgesic and anti-erythemic effects and the ability to block lipooxygenase were said to surpass those of thc (evans, 1991). cbg dem- onstrated modest antifungal effects (elsohly et al ., 1982). more recently, it proved to be an effective cytotoxic in high dosage on human epithelioid carcinoma (baek et al ., 1998), is the next most effective phytocannabinoid against breast cancer after cbd (ligresti et al ., 2006), is an antidepressant in the rodent tail suspension model (musty and deyo, 2006) and is a mildly anti-hypertensive agent (maor et al ., 2006). additionally, cbg inhibits keratinocyte proliferation suggest- ing utility in psoriasis (wilkinson and williamson, 2007), it is a relatively potent trpm8 antagonist for possible application in prostate cancer (de petrocellis and di marzo, 2010) and detrusor over-activity and bladder pain (mukerji et al ., 2006). it is a strong aea uptake inhibitor (de petrocellis et al ., 2011) and a powerful agent against mrsa (appendino et al ., 2008; vide infra ).    &amp;nbsp;   &gt;**thcv** is a propyl analogue of thc, and can modulate intoxication of the latter, displaying 25% of its potency in early testing (gill et al ., 1970; hollister, 1974). a recrudescence of interest accrues to this compound, which is acb 1 antagonist at lower doses (thomas et al ., 2005), but is a cb 1 agonist at higher doses (pertwee, 2008). thcv produces weight loss, decreased body fat and serum leptin concentra- tions with increased energy expenditure in obese mice (cawthorne et al ., 2007; riedel et al ., 2009). thcv also dem- onstrates prominent anticonvulsant properties in rodent cer- ebellum and pyriform cortex (hill et al ., 2010). thcv appears as a fractional component of many southern african can- nabis chemotypes, although plants highly predominant in this agent have been produced (de meijer, 2004). thcv recently  demonstrated  a  cb 2 -based  ability  to  suppress carageenan-induced hyperalgesia and inflammation, and both phases of formalin-induced pain behaviour via cb 1 and cb 2 in mice (bolognini et al ., 2010).     &amp;nbsp;  &gt;**cbdv** , the propyl analogue of cbd, was first isolated in 1969 (vollner et al ., 1969), but formerly received little investigation. pure cbdv inhibits diacylglycerol lipase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic 50 ) 16.6 m m] and might decrease activity of its product, the endocannabinoid, 2-ag (de petrocellis et al ., 2011). it is also anticonvulsant in rodent hippocampal brain slices, comparable to phenobarbitone and felbamate (jones et al ., 2010)    &amp;nbsp;  &gt; **cbn** is a non-enzymatic oxidative by-product of thc, more prominent in aged cannabis samples (merzouki and mesa, 2002). it has a lower affinity for cb 1 (ki 211.2 nm) and cb2 (ki126.4 nm) (rhee et al ., 1997); and was judged inactive when tested alone in human volunteers, but pro- duced greater sedation combined with thc (mustyet al,1976). cbn demonstrated anticonvulsant (turner et al ., 1980), anti-inflammatory (evans, 1991) and potent effects against mrsa (mic 1mg·ml -cbn is a trpv2 (high- threshold thermosensor) agonist (ec 77.7 m m) of possible interest in treatment of burns (qin et al ., 2008). like cbg, it inhibits keratinocyte proliferation (wilkinson and william- son, 2007), independently of cannabinoid receptor effects. cbn stimulates the recruitment of quiescent mesenchymal stem cells in marrow (10 m m), suggesting promotion of bone formation (scutt and williamson, 2007)
t3_g2wr2-t1_c1kjuwz-c1kk36q	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6856	i seem to cause miraculous recoveries as well.  two or three years ago, i went to go stay with my dad and step mom one summer, because water had accumulated in her heart and two of her valves were malfunctioning.  my dad had to work and she was already really weak and expected to have high risk open heart surgery, so they needed someone to be there with her all the time; they couldn't afford a nurse and i was out of work, so it seemed fitting.  they went in for an exam a week before the scheduled date, to confirm the procedure's necessity and that was when i decided to go.  i hung out with them two days before, the day before and the day of the surgery.  however, when they did the pre-procedure exam (i can't remember what it's called, but it's when they run a camera up your veins to see your heart), her heart was working **perfectly fine**.  the surgeon (who, at the time, was rated third in the country for this procedure) swore he had never seen nor heard of this happening and held her for close observation (they did the same procedure to her three more times over three days) before discharging her.  she wound up making a "full" recovery (diet adjustment, prescriptions, etc.) and they never cracked her chest open.  when i was in high school, my sister had a massive car accident - the driver over corrected off the bank of a freeway at 70 mph and rolled the car four times.  she had a closed head injury that was rated at a level 1 brain injury (coma) and was rushed to the hospital via life flight.  by the time she got there, it had been upgraded to level 2 but she was in such critical condition the doctors couldn't do anything.  so, of course, my mom pulls me out of school and we go visit her.  not 10 minutes after i went in to see her, the doctors did another exam and upgraded her to level 3.  she went on to have a full recovery (well, as near to full as you can from that sort of thing, there is some permanent damage and her life expectancy is shortened by 10-15 years) in the next 4 hours or so and was home with us the next day.  the year after i graduated high school, and was away at college, my mom got diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time.  the first time, the cancer had never progressed all the way to stage 1 before it went into remission and she had never told us (i was like 9 at the time, so it's understandable that she didn't bring it up because it was never "serious").  this time, it had progressed really rapidly and was already stage 2 when it was diagnosed (my mom had lapsed on her breast exams, shame on her).  my mom's not exactly a very forthcoming person with things she thinks are personal weaknesses, so she didn't tell me about this until it had progressed to stage 3 and the doctors were afraid that it was going to metastasize and had scheduled and immediate surgery - two days later.  i, of course, got in the car and drove home (i made the trip from daytona beach to nashville in just under 7 hours and got 2 speeding tickets in 2 states doing it).  i got there and spent the night and next day for her.  she went to the hospital and did her pre-procedure exam and the doctor called it off, as the tumor had shrunk.  they kept her in the hospital for 3 days to do observation and decided that the cancer had spontaneously gone into remission and were able to operate and only remove the tumor, rather than her entire breast.   those three occurrences are the only medical emergencies where someone's life has been threatened that i've been party to. i guess the universe balances out?  that's a scary thought.
t3_1ic3si-t3_1ic3si-cb3n3bj	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6627	years ago, my then boss was telling me about his wife's symptoms. she had a lump and pain in her breast, and she had been to the dr, who, upon hearing that her sister had died of breast cancer, told this mother of four children under ten years old that she had it (without any tests, wtf?!) and probably had six months to live. i had recently had a baby, and was nursing, and the symptoms sounded to me like mastitis, which can be cleared up by antibiotics. i told him to have her get a second opinion and i brought in some information for them, and sure enough, she had mastitis. she also had a nursing toddler, so that should have been one of the first things they thought of.  a few years ago, my mil was visiting us. when she arrived she didn't seem right. headaches, sleeping all the time. what clinched it for me was when she wasn't making sense, forgetting things like it being fathers day about fifteen times on that day, things that we had told her, etc. i finally left work, and insisted she go to the er, thinking she was taking too many medications and was having a drug interaction. they did a ct scan and told us she had a tumor in her brain and admitted her. a few days later, she saw a specialist and it turned out to be a large craniopharyngioma, which is a cyst on the pituitary. scary stuff. she had surgery and is basically fine now.  last week, my kid's friend, who had just returned from sleep away camp, asked me to look at a bug bite she had. she thought it was a tick bite. she was right, and the red ring around it told me she had lyme disease, so i told her parents she needed to be seen. se was, and she has lyme, but is on antibiotics and should be fine since we caught it early.  a friend i only know online asked me about some symptoms she was having after having her gallbladder out. i said it sounded like she had an impacted gallstone and she had jaundice and needed to get checked out right away, like er now. didn't hear from her for a few days since she was in the hospital being treated for jaundice from an impacted gallstone.  i am not a doctor, have no medical training other than cpr/first aid.
t3_2l56c6-t3_2l56c6-clrlprz	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	not a proper answer but i guess it all depends on type, location etc etc.   my mother had breast cancer with a  double mastectomy which failed to catch it and it spread to all parts of the body but eventually died from lesions  on the brain  she didn't suffer a single days pain over the years involved. a state which caused utter bewilderment  in the medical staff involved who always came in expecting to dope her up to the gills.    but for which then, as well as now many years later, i only had heartfelt relief

t3_4xymkj-t3_4xymkj-d6k5q7u	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	late on this, but i'm still so pissed off at this professor.    mid-semester (too late to drop courses) the entire right side of my body went numb.  i couldn't write or type easily, and it was pretty nerve-wracking because i had a ton of doctors' appointments to figure out what was wrong.  i told my professors because my classwork was affected.  i was eventually diagnosed with ms.  i emailed my professors to ask for incomplete grades because it was a lot to process, and i was struggling with the symptoms as well as wrapping my 20-year-old brain around having an incurable and possibly debilitating illness.  all of my professors were very nice about it and agreed to give me incompletes so i could take the rest of the semester to get second opinions and figure out treatment.  one professor in particular, my chemistry professor, even went so far as to commiserate with me about medical issues.  she told me she had dealt with breast cancer and understood how difficult these things could be.   fast-forward a few weeks to the end of a semester; the chemistry professor failed me.  i figured she probably just forgot and emailed her.  her response was "i changed my mind."  what?!?!?  i was devastated.  had i known, i could have made some effort to try to finish the class.  it is literally one of the biggest reasons i took a 5 year break from school before going back (almost finished now, at a different school).  fuck that professor.
t3_304xv0-t3_304xv0-cppivac	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	my mom had had some weird medical problems, including two rounds of breast cancer, one of which got a paper written on it because of the weird shape the tumor was in. she'd had a chest mri recently that was clear, but she was starting to have trouble walking. neurologist sent her in for a head mri because it looked like ms, and she could just have lesions on her brain and upper spinal chord.  the morning after the mri, she woke up unable to control her lower body. i drove her to the er, and the doc there acted like he had no idea why she was up there and pretty much blew her off, saying that she should have just made an appointment with the neurologist again. fortunately, the nurses paid more attention, checked her bladder and did a catheter before it burst. her md had been notified when he came in, so he stopped for a visit and was ready to murder the er doc when he heard what happened.   he arranged for a transfer to a different hospital on the spot. turns out her cancer had come back in the space of a couple months and had spread to her spine. it eventually killed her, but thanks to quick treatment (tumor removal, reinstating chemo, etc,) she lasted almost another year.  tl;dr: er doc nearly let my mom's bladder burst and could have ended up delaying cancer treatment.

t3_2rvfew-t3_2rvfew-cnjoo13	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.663	my mom having brain tumors.  the year before she had breast cancer and she had surgery, chemo and during radiation they found it had spread to her stomach. and it was about 8 months from her first diagnosis.. she had trouble with one of her hands, i forget which. i think it was her right because she was right handed. she couldn't hold a utensil or things like that. her other hand was fine, i remember that. and i remembered learning in psychology in high school how the brain affects the left or right part of our body and i remember thinking it had spread to her brain.  it was my first year of college, i was 18 and i remember going to pick her up from chemo. she usually met me outside. i was working and went to classes. and i remember being annoyed she was late, a memory that has haunted me to this day. i parked and went inside and she was on the floor surrounded by nurses and doctors. and thats the night we found out it spread to her brain. it was a couple of weeks after i noticed the changes in her.  she died a few months later. two weeks after mothers day. i remember that on mothers day i bought her her favorite soup for mothers day and she was never hungry enough to eat it and i had to throw it out after she died.
t3_4xzxe3-t1_d6karlx-d6kbalo	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.5243	my aunt had breast cancer and my nine-year-old cousin has stage four brain cancer. i understand the pain and the fear, man. my aunt is alive and well (successfully had a mastectomy) and my little cousin is a fucking warrior and is receiving chemo right now. all you can do is support your mom. i know this is terrifying for both of you, but you can find strength in each other and others that care about you both. try to keep strong, but don't be afraid to acknowledge the hardships that you and your mom are battling, and don't be afraid when you occasionally feel weak. hope it works out. i'm sure it will
t3_22kt5a-t3_22kt5a-cgnve4b	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	because it is really easy to cure cancer in a very specific environment in rats.   it is far harder to cure it in humans with the hundreds of thousands of different variants and situations that exist.  firstly, i absolutely hate the term "cure cancer" because cancer isn't one disease. it's hundreds, with varying levels of danger. breast cancer, if detected on time, is nearly never fatal. the worst that happens is the loss of a breast, but that is nothing compared to keeping your life. hard to detect cancers like lung cancer are much more dangerous. it is nearly impossible to treat and even harder to catch, so when they do catch it it's too late. there is also skin cancer, bone marrow cancer, prostate cancer, brain cancer, etc etc. each with different causes, each with different treatments. there is no and never will be a singular cure for cancer.   but it is easy to write "octopus eggs cure cancer". it is really easy to write that. when in fact they found that protein xy1234 in the eggs of an octopus makes cancerous cells in rat spinal chord cancer more susceptible to chemo, meaning you can use slightly less powerful chemicals and have people not experience such bad effects.   but, after the trial with rats are done they may go on to a more complicated animal. find one with spinal chord cancer. see that the protein did nothing to said animal and that maybe with the rat it was a fluke, or something else made the cancer weaker. whatever it is, it's back to the drawing board.   so yeah. blame the media for hopping onto each lab report that the sap from an african tree cures cancer in one rat and making it read sap cures cancer.
t3_28axzi-t3_28axzi-ci96h93	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	yes they are stupid in this, but lets talk about depression vs adhd.    1)  people commit suicide due to depression and it is obvious after the fact that the person was depressed and it was probably one of the reason they committed suicide (even though with suicide there is often no single reason but instead a multiude of reasons).  2)  everybody can be sad so it is a lot easier for people to understand a bleakness that does not go away.  it is a lot easier to empathize with.  -----  add to the fact  3)  scientist while they know adhd exist have not "proven" how adhd occurs.  scientists though have a good knowledge of how to treat it, and thus a good idea why it occurs, but they have not found the multitude of magical genes and environmental factors that will trigger the various forms of brain chemistry that causes adhd.  thus you have doubt it really exists unlike something like breast cancer where you can say this defective gene causes you to have a 50% to 66% to have breast cancer by age 70.  4)  there is no good test for adhd, instead you watch a person with adhd and once you have a good knowledge of their history, you test drugs on them and see if they improve.  -----  now combine 1, 2, 3 and 4 and add these things (which add controversy and non seriousness to the discussion)  5)  corporations are evil, adhd drugs have massive increases in sales in the last 35 or so years and the amount of diagnosis have skyrocketed.  i would argue this was due to the ama adding adhd in 1980 to the list of official disorders and thus more attention was going to adhd.  with more people being diagnosed we gain a better understanding of adhd and the drug companies modified existing drugs to work better for adhd (time release).  furthermore by discovering by accident we found out other drugs (wellburtin, other antidepressants, strattera, intuniv, kapvay) actually also treat adhd symptoms.  in effect it was not a science problem but instead a testing and marketing problem and the drug industry excels at the last two but they are not good at creating new drugs from scratch/accident for that is damn hard.  6)  younger and younger kids are being diagnosed with adhd and treated with medicines and this scares people.  how can you know a toddler or 5 year old has something with no test?  7)  there are some people that do not believe adhd exist, and the media (not just the nyt) tries to be "balanced" by stating it as a controversy.  **8)  people that advocate adhd suck at communicating.**  if you can not give a 2 sentence answer on how you are like people (so they can empathize) and yet tell them how you fundamentally are different and **why this disorder is serious and life changing.**  then you will not be taken seriously.  on point 8 we do have a two sentence answer, but the two sentence answer stinks.  "saying its hard for me to focus.  unlike you its all the time" is a thing people associate with silliness and non seriousness.
t3_1c1c2p-t3_1c1c2p-c9cb6mp	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i have a few things that have happened to my family that have defied explanation for me. this story has bigger picture but this is the best synopsis i've got.  1: my grandmother, about 20 years ago drove up on a car accident in her town. relatively small town and a two lane highway. she noticed the car smoking and in the ditch and saw the driver in the seat struggling to get out of the car. she talked to him for just moment and assessed injuries. serious head trauma, open wound across his head and arm. he was coherent, but was scared to death due to a severe loss of blood. she asked him his name and he told her. she got up and went to her car grabbed her bible and recited a verse from it including his name, about a minute in time lapsed. she kneeled next him and both the head wound and the arm wound had stopped bleeding. he was very awake, looked at her and asked "what did you do? the bleeding just, stopped." she said that she said a prayer.   2: growing up in a christian home, i've witnessed prayer do alot of things. another thing that happened was to my wife's first cousin. 8 years ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. my wife, told the pastor about it and we began to pray for her. she eventually had to have her breasts removed and underwent chemo as well. lost her hair, everything, it was really, really bad. so about 6 months go by and she starts complaining with horrendous headaches. she goes in and finds out that the cancer has spread to her brain. they do chemo, and ultimately brain surgery. they remove what they can, and say there's nothing they can do and stop all treatment. the church finds out and starts praying for her. she goes in for a followup a month later to find out how long she has and it's gone. in its entirety. i mean, literally, gone. she's been cancer free for 5 1/2 years now.   got several other stories but don't have time to write anymore right this moment. edited for fat fingers hitting the wrong numbers
t3_2y1rsv-t3_2y1rsv-cp6yv9r	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.665	you're right. outlook is not good. went through it with my mother. it was the metastasized breast cancer. i did a lot of internet research and knew it was coming and think it helped me process the death before it happened. other family members were in denial and the impact was much more severe to them once she passed. if i personally was talking to someone about to go through what i did, i would suggest seeing a therapist throughout to process what is going on. i did and am glad i did. i cried a lot in there but it helped me process. like i said some family members didn't and i can't help but think it would have helped them tremendously. just be there for your friend if he wants to talk about it or if he doesn't. i got very tired of talking about it that i avoided people to not have to talk about it. it will be on his mind with every conversation, interaction he has.    i never understood people giving food for people in tough times until i went through this and realized between all the trips to the pharmacy, doctors  and with care giving no one has time to cook or even get take out. dad lost a lot of weight, he was too exhausted to remember to eat. perhaps organize people giving prepared meals when things progress and your friends days are filled with the care giving.  with my mom they found the lesions in her spine first when she complained of back pai n after 17 years in remission. the doctor said the longest they had seem someone live from that stage was 2 years. my mom made it 4. once we knew it was in her brain stem the doctors said they were stopping treatment. it was heartbreaking to see someone hear that news when they wanted to keep fighting. my mom passed away within 4 months of them finding it in her brain.  over the 4 years she fought like hell and tried every cancer fighting drug available, was part of many drug studies, had blood transfusions, took bone strengthening meds. she did radiation and chemo.  some of the drugs that were in study stage when she tried them have now passed so i hope these drugs improve the outlook.    going through it all it was comforting to know people i did not expect to care did care. so touching to see who all came to the funeral to provide support. people are amazing. a group of friends sent a gift basket full of tea, cheese, snacks, chocolate to me with a thoughtful thinking of you card. that was very comforting. we didn't necessarily sit down and enjoy the basket, more so had snacks and comfort food when we were on the run. i was so touched by the unexpected gesture.  i think responding to this may have helped me too. i am a reddit lurker, not a poster but feel like i was meant to come across this post and respond. you are a good friend! just keep doing what you're doing.

t3_z8h47-t3_z8h47-c62gynn	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7856	i had to watch my mother die from breast cancer for over a year. the cancer eventually metastasized to basically everywhere (eyes, brain, breast, liver, kidney). she got put into the hospital for what they would discover later was a liver that  was not filtering blood but i woke up on a sunday morning ecstatic to visit her like i had every other day and my aunt's phone rings (she stayed with us so my dad could stay at the hospital). i run and get it for her and stand there while she answers it, just to see complete devastation fill her being. pretty difficult for an 11 year old to deal with. not to mention that jut over a year later, my grandmother died of cancer and 6 months after that my other grandmother died of cancer. this all happened 4  and a half years ago but just last week i learned that one of my aunts was diagnosed with brain cancer and her brother in law has lymphoma.  tl;dr **fuck cancer**
t3_m0b12-t1_c2x25n0-c2x317i	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	well, if you want to extend selfishness to some kind of all inclusive buddhist/pantheist/panentheist/pagan kind of definition, then i guess altruism would have to be selfish so long as we're aware of others.  logically speaking, empathy can't exist.  or if it did then we wouldn't be able to support the idea of the self.  i'm pretty sure david lewis talks about this when he talks about sherlock holmes and the blob.  that's because he embeds it in modal logic.  i can't remember his argument though.  aristotle also talks about this when he talks about the tragedy and catharsis.  but if you want to talk about psychology, catharsis doesn't work, it makes matters worse.  one of the things i think of when i think of empathy:  a family member dies, somebody says to you "i know how you feel."  well, you can say "thank you" and take it as some kind of sympathy, or you can say "no you fucking don't" and reject empathy.  but to say "yes, i know you understand" implies that another person knew all your ties, all your relations, and every single bit about why that person was meaningful (or not) to you.  or another case:  you develop cancer.  one of your buddies says "i know how you must feel, my mother had cancer."  well, yeah, the mother had cancer but not the person who is speaking to you.  and then there is the whole point that people experience things different, which means that two people with breast cancer don't even understand how the other feels.  they understand that parts of it suck, and of course we understand some things like pain.  but we don't ever know what another persons pain is.  we can't _feel_ for somebody else, because it's connected to their consciousness and self awareness.  it's a brain thing.  the existential state, and existential experiences are why we can't experience empathy.  we can assume that we know something similar, but then we're taking a guess.  epistemologically speaking there are a million problems that come from that.  here is an exercise, assuming you're pretty decent with symbolic logic.  try to write out an argument to prove empathy.  try to prove it is different from sympathy.  you would have to bastardize the term, and then it's not empathy anymore.  in terms of misanthropy, i don't really think this is a clear correlation either.  i think this is what happens when we confuse rationality with ethics.  because we're irrational doesn't mean we're unethical.  especially since the former deals with biological concerns, and the latter deals with our perception of applied biological terms to make social imperatives.
t3_2rujox-t3_2rujox-cnjphd2	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	oh do i know health anxiety. it's the worst and it has run large portions of my life. at it's worst, i was barely functional. couldn't sleep, was having anxiety attacks all the time and was getting very depressed. it's so terrible to think that you're constantly going to die and constantly looking for new symptoms in your body.   this fall, i decided enough was enough and decided to see a psychologist. it has helped tremendously! while my health anxiety isn't gone, it is certainly more manageable and i'm coping much better. here are the tips i've learned:  1) stay off google, web md, all of that stuff! it does not help to google symptoms, even though you have a strong desire to do it at the time. it never helps. if your symptoms are incredibly troubling, or you want to ease your mind, go to your doctor. they're the only ones qualified to diagnose you. and just as a heads up, if your doctor orders blood tests or ultrasounds or whatever, don't freak out. it's easy to go "they must think i'm dying, why else would they order these tests for me?!?!", but it's important to remember that they're just doing their job. they're being thorough and you went there for a reason. i've gone and had lots of tests ordered and they've all come back normal or something that requires a very simple fix. it's never been anything serious or life threatening.   2) i don't know what you're currently obsessing over (for myself, i bounce around to different things. one week it's ovarian cancer, another week it's ms, another week i have a brain tumor, another month i have lupus, another time it's breast cancer, etc, etc.) but one thing i found surprisingly helpful was keeping a "pain log." for example, i had been experiencing pain in my lower groin and up my side. i was convinced that i had some sort of cancer in that area. my psychologist had me keep a pain log, where i would track my pain from a scale of 1-10 throughout the day (1 being barely there, 10 being unbearable). i would right down my pain after events during the day - for example, breakfast, dance class, lunch, homework, dinner, etc). to my surprise, the pain never made it past a 3 and usually was at a 1 or 2. i realized that my pain was made worse when i was doing exercise or just after, and that i was making it out to be so much worse in my head than it was. i went and saw a sports doctor and they told me i had a joint that was out of place, causing all the pain. not cancer at all, totally harmless :)   3) every time i've been convinced i'm dying, i'm not. i know that i have health anxiety and i know that i pay way too much attention to the symptoms that go on in my body. just try to keep perspective and remind yourself that you've been fine before and you will be fine again, and this is the anxiety taking hold.   4) stop checking. this was huge for me. whenever something new would pop up, i would google it, press it, check it, look at it, etc. breaking the cycle of checking is hard but once you do you will feel so much more free. checking is what keeps you in that anxiety loop and keeps you obsessing over it. in the beginning, even if you can delay your checking by 20 minutes, that's good. during those twenty minutes, do some evidence based thinking or writing. "what are the odds that i really have this? what is the evidence that this is something benign?", etc. after a while, you want to stop the checking all together.  5) stay active and healthy and engaged. i tend to get into slumps during my really bad phases of anxiety. try to stay as engaged in your life as possible, or take up a new sport or hobby! exercise is super helpful. i started doing hot yoga and found that within a couple weeks, i was feeling much better mentally and physically.   6) this is a random one, and i don't necessarily recommend starting with this strategy but it has been useful to me at certain points in my life. it sounds counter intuitive, but it works. if you can't stop obsessing, no matter what, then go ahead. give yourself twenty minutes or half an hour where you freak out and check and worry and lose your mind. don't let your mind wander to anything else. if you stop worrying, make yourself worry again about this. for 30 minutes, worrying is all you're allowed to do. once those 30 minutes are up there, then they're done. carry on with the rest of your day and push the anxious thoughts away when they come in. then, do it again the next day. 30 minutes of worry time. you'll be surprised how quickly the anxiety becomes boring and less interesting when you make yourself do it. again, i don't need to use this strategy anymore because i've gotten quite good at using the other techniques but i've used it before and weirdly enough it was a good tactic.   those are the best things i did for myself. it takes time and practice and i think it's great you're planning on seeing someone, it really does help. anxiety sucks and it really sucks to think you're dying all the time. don't give up, i know it's incredibly difficult getting through the dark times but you can and will get better and you will learn how to cope with this. good luck!!!
t3_2qd2ql-t1_cn5a8rn-cn5bl73	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7961	i'm not the most patient person, and it feels like i've already waited a lifetime (hell, technically, i have - and we have). this isn't fair. it is not fair for there to exist a society in which if i had breast cancer and simply needed mastectomy for that, there are multiple local surgeons who would want to take care of me, and who even take both my insurance sources.  yet if i am a man, and just need bodily congruency, well, fuck me, right?  meanwhile, there are options, perhaps in other states. perhaps in other cities. but nothing comes close to being available in this bumfuck nowheresville territory that has a reputation only for black market marijuana and nothing else. literally nothing good comes from this hellhole.  mind over matter. i understand but it simultaneously strikes me the same way "get over it" does when people tell me to stop being depressed. or angry. or anything else that feels out of my control. a lot of it is actually out of my control, and only regular medicine can hope to temporarily tame it.  so the chemical misfiring of my brain factors in and makes this already troubling circumstance into an insurmountable mountain fit for nothing except jumping off of.  figuratively speaking.  i am doing everything i can to feel better, but it does not help. what helps is progress. what helps is feeling like i'm doing something towards getting these damn surgeries i need so badly. fixing this body. sitting here ignoring it may eventually help, but that help is temporary at best and doesn't bring me any closer.  i'm sorry. i have no issue with your advice. i appreciate it. thank you. and i shall use it. and i am doubly sorry that you're experiencing it to. i wouldn't wish it on anyone. i just doubt i'll ever save up enough, because i live paycheck to paycheck and have debt out my ass and a credit score that is absolute shit (less than 500 and falling) and just see no way out of this hole because i am unemployable, cannot work, draw disability, and am barely able to make ends meet each month.  the system is rigged against people like me.

t3_dnlor-t1_c11kzo6-c11l2ui	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i agree. my father has brain cancer and it seems to make people far more uncomfortable than breast cancer. i think that the whole "breast cancer awareness" thing has been blown up into a fun boob party for some of these marketers. like many others, i have known several people who have had breast cancer, and all this "i like it on..." and pink shit doesn't seem to do too much. i'd rather see people donate money than update their facebook statuses.   also, according to [this](http://www.cancerservicesonline.org/cancer_awareness.asp) website, there are nine months of the year that have some time dedicated to some form of cancer. in theory, we should be wearing and doing stuff for every form of cancer out there, not just the popular ones.

t3_3uo16o-t1_cxgi3d3-cxgmqxc	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7435	about 20 years ago, my mother got diagnosed with breast cancer. she had a mastectomy and chemo and came out ahead after a year of fighting it. she spent the next 10 years going in for her yearly checkup, finally being declared a success after her 10th trip. i remember we all kind of celebrated when we found out-nothing formal, mind you, just a kind of collective family sigh of relief.  about a year later, she tripped coming down the steps and landed pretty hard on her left hip. she was only in her late 50s, so not quite into the classic "old lady falls and breaks her hip and spends the rest of her life using a walker" stage, but, still, old enough for some concern, so she went to the hospital to get checked out, ya know, just to make sure she didn't break anything.  they found a tumor on the x-ray. fucking motherfucking, piece-of-shit, cock-sucking bone cancer. she beat breast cancer only to have a completely different type jump up and kick her in the face anyway.   now, the problem with bone cancers is: it's damn near impossible to actually cure them. soft tissue cancers, they can cut out the big chunks, pump you full of poison and have a decent shot at eliminating it, but that's pretty difficult to do when it comes to bone cancer, especially when it's in the pelvic girdle. but they *can* generally control them, at least as long as the treatments keep working. as her oncologist often said, "my job in this is to keep the cancer away long enough for something else to kill you". my mom stuck with her because she appreciated her candor and brusk manner.  the first treatment she went on (the one with the least amount of side-effects, she was determined to avoid anything like the effects of chemo she had been through with the breast cancer, especially since now it wouldn't be working towards a cure) was explained as likely only working for about six months before either the cancer got out ahead of it or the side effects (neuropathy of the hands being the most common) got too bad to endure. that shit worked for damn near five years before it's efficacy started to drop off. then started the cycling of treatments (including two that didn't exist when she was first diagnosed): a year here, six months there.    until finally, last november, they reached the point where the only  options left were the really extreme forms of chemo. those ones that took all your hair and left you sick for 5 days after your weekly treatment. well, my mom literally feared those more than death, so she opted to discontinue treatment and switch to comfort care. we had a great christmas: my daughter was home for a week from the army and the rest of us lived close, so we got to spend a lot of time with her while she was feeling pretty strong. less than a month later, one week before my birthday, she was gone. we were lucky in that, unlike many who pass from bone cancer, her pain was well-controlled and she died peacefully.  during this time, we always wondered if every holiday with her was going to be the last. every celebration had that faint pall of death floating over it, because we never knew if her cancer was going to metastasize into someplace like her brain or pancreas and take her from us in a few days or weeks. some of her greatest worries involved missing events in her grandchildren's lives. but she got to see both of my kids graduate from 8th grade, multiple formal dances, my daughter's quinceanera, my daughter's high school and army graduations, my graduation from community college (after i went back to redeem my earlier mistakes that lead to my dropping out when i was 18) and she only missed my son's high school graduation and my university graduation by a few months. so at least she knew things were going to be good for us.  tl;dr: fucking fuck cancer.
t3_1ev91z-t1_ca44kcc-ca47t44	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.6709	this one hit me very hard because my father died about 13 years ago (as of june) from cancer, and his rapid decline within less than a year (he started showing signs of illness in november of 1999, and was dead in june of 2000) so fast that no treatment would have been successful (it was stage 4 carcinoma, which had aggressively spread from his right kidney and into his lungs, they presumed it had started at least 8 months to a year prior, and by the time he was feeling sick (pneumonia that didnt quit) it had eaten one lung and taken out the other. chemotherapy had helped it advance faster and by the time he died, it had taken out one lung completely, where it no longer functioned, but was a mass of cancer cells, and the other one was beginning to fail, and had spread into his heart, which is why it gave out when someone yelled at him. (that's another rage inducing story)    then my mother had a cancer scare in 2003 that were benign cysts and growths on her ovaries. they removed 11 lbs of mass from her abdomen.   then after christmas of 2010, early 2011, my mother had a spasm in her neck that resulted in ungodly amounts of pain. after dealing with a bunch of idiots who misdiagnosed it as a plethora of things, one idiot got it mostly right and claimed she had a cyst on her bicep. got to the surgeon and he took one glance at the x-ray and went nope. had her go to a cancer specialist at a prominent hospital. turned out she had three tumors on her right arm. two on her bicep, and one in her shoulder that wrapped around her brachial plexus, disabling her arm.  worse, that one was a stage 4 tumor, a sarcoma. thankfully we caught it just as it was about to grow into some crucial tissue (bone tissue, and an inch away from breast tissue). chemotherapy and surgical removal once the tumor shrunk down to the size of an egg, it was gone, with all traces of cancer gone.  however, during all of that, i saw her go through many of the same stages as that woman went through. it was heartbreaking and scary because we had yet to know if the treatment was working. she spent a good part of 2012 partially paralyzed due to the after effects of chemo (spoilers: it wreaks havoc on your nervous system and causes minor brain damage, this is something they won't tell you upfront.)   she's back to being mobile again, but it's scary and heartbreaking, especially if you already lost one parent as it is.
t3_2dxn19-t1_cjuhfun-cjuhroe	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	my point is it is divisive to prioritize one experience over any other, especially when scientific research supports the idea that there are a lot of commonalities between transgender and cisgender women; morphological similarities indicate that despite different genitals, our brain patterns can function in very similar ways.  i have never and will never presumed to understand what it means to be a woman. there are too many people from too many backgrounds with too diverse an array of experiences to characterize them all as the woman experience. the fact that all of them, as a composite, form a conversation about what it means to be a woman in the first place is instructive, i think, because it demonstrates that many people don't share a common life story, but can share attributes that we can use to build real coalitions of lgbt allies, especially allies for women.  i would likewise contend that characterizing the discussion as one about genitals first is trivializing and triggering for a whole host of women, as there are women born with penises, without vulva, many different forms, shapes and variations of labia. there are men who grow breasts or are born with vulva, so using the body as a benchmark for deciding who gets to be a woman is decidedly problematic. while i would not throw a fit in attending a penis convention, i might be slightly upset that you won't even let me participate in an equal member of the conversation because you are making presumptions about my life and body experience about which you are not qualified. i don't currently have a vagina, though i desperately wish i could have been born into a cisgender female body. is it fair for you to limit out my experience because i have different parts than you? what about breast cancer survivors who have double mastectomies? intersex folk who are born with both, opposite, or neither genital configurations? they have valid life experiences too, and it seems overly trivial to try and place one of those on a pedestal as necessarily more important because of a fixation on bodies which no one should feel comfortable policing.

t3_abwcx-t3_abwcx-c0gtz11	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7587	oh sweetness, how i can relate.  12 years ago i was diagnosed with stage iv inflammatory breast cancer. the cancer had spread to numerous places and surgery was definitely not an option. i was six weeks past my 31st birthday and told reaching my 32nd was very unlikely. google me. i use my real name. i've been covered in numerous newspapers, magazines and television. my case is also taught at the va as how not to treat a patient.   1. ignore the prognosis. ignore the prognosis. did you hear what i said? ignore the prognosis. doctors practice the art of medicine. they are not fortune-tellers.  2. call social security. immediately. ask them what forms are needed  to receive disability. liver cancer isn't fun, but it is survivable. you will need to get the social security disability application started now. essentially you get a form from the social security website, take it to the doctor, s/he fills it out saying you are unable to work for a least a year because of an advanced cancer diagnosis and you return it to the ssa.   3. stay on top of them. they have lots of hoops for you to jump through. keep jumping. once you get the social security disability, you are automatically qualified for your state's medicaid. (an advanced cancer is much more likely to be fast-tracked than a soft-tissue injury like a hurt back.)   4. go the nci website. look at the liver cancer section. read everything. start here: http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/adult-primary-liver/patient. i can tell you when you look up my cancer it says almost everyone dies in the first 5 years and the rest die in the next 5 years. clearly i am still here 12 year later. the statistics don't matter as you are a statistic of one. ignore the doctor's prognostics.   5. since it doesn't sound like you have much of a support system, or at least one you'd like to use right now, you need to take the lead on this. figure out what options you have for treatment if money is no object. this is the treatment you are going to fight for.   when i was diagnosed, i was told repeatedly, by numerous different doctors and numerous different hospitals that i was going to die. one was kind enough to give me the contact information for hospice. i chose to ignore them. it was hard. when i first got the diagnosis, i cried for an entire day. then i got on the internet for the next three days and researched my brain out. i looked at all the research. if they had published in english, i called them. i called some researcher in italy, another in south africa, and a dozen across the us. i figured out the latest and greatest treatments and went back to the doctors and told them how we were going to proceed.   i fired lots of doctors. if they didn't believe i could survive, i didn't want them anywhere around me or my care. my cancer was a rare one, but those who did know what it was almost always gave me what i called the deer in the headlight look. they were incredulous that despite a very advanced case of inflammatory breast cancer, i was still alive, standing there and getting pissed because i was kept waiting.   i was always kind of an in-your-face person. that served me well. i was such a pain in the ass, it was easier to treat me than to not treat me. i wasn't rude, but i was the most persistent patient they had ever seen. and sometimes i needed to be rude. you need to become the most persistent patient they have ever seen.   6. in the mean time, track down the social service arm of the hospital. what services are available?   7. google liver cancer support groups. i wasn't much for the emotional support, but these support groups have people who are ahead of you in treatment. ask what others are getting in terms of treatment for a similarly staged liver cancer. also, there are thousands of people diagnosed with cancer who don't have insurance. find out what options others have found on these support groups.   8. when i found out i had cancer i was alone. i told my boyfriend at the time and then called my mother later that night. i have a large family. the telephone tree started and within an hour all my parents, siblings, aunts and uncles knew. and they sprung into action. it was certainly a shock, but no one had any meltdown other than me. my mother cried later, but not when i told her. i didn't phrase it that i was going to die, i just said i had a rare breast cancer and that it had spread. lots of people didn't even know there were different kinds of breast cancer, so i didn't necessarily have to go into detail. it was just kind of matter of fact.  9. there isn't a cancer in the world that someone hasn't survived. make certain you are that someone.  10. email me privately for my phone. i volunteer for the bloch cancer foundation and speak with young, newly-diagnosed, advanced cancer patients all the time.   this is a lot to take in right now. i haven't even touched on finances, the time commitment, the feeling that someone pushed the pause button on your life while everyone else's life moves merrily forward. i understand all these thing and an happy to offer suggestions, information and cheerleading and the occasional kick in the butt.  don't give up before you even begin to fight.
t3_1t83i1-t1_ce5b81f-ce5cmsh	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	yes there are other cancers, i had skin cancer myself. however, breast cancer is very curable when found early. all it takes is a screening to save so many lives.   no one would find it reasonable for everyone to go get a brain scan to check for a brain tumor. breast cancer is more common, easily detectable, and when found early on, curable.
t3_2e3x7h-t3_2e3x7h-cjw6uzq	brain_cancer	relevant	1.0	i had this happen to me just this last week (i'm male btw). my mom had headaches and was vomiting (she has had cervical and breast cancer which lead to bone cancer) this was concerning so my sister took her to the er.  my sister needed to get some sleep for work the next day so i stayed with my mom for 3 hours until the doctor came in and examined my mom (4:00am at this point). the doctor ordered a ct scan on the head, around 5:30am and had the doctor tell my mom and i that there was something showing in the ct scan.  i immediately thought it was brain cancer, but it wasn't official until the radiologist came in and did a more thorough ct scan + dye.  i was outside my mom's room sitting and contemplating breaking the news to the family, managing to hold it together and not cry at this point.  it wasn't until the nurse ask me how i was doing that i just completely broke down.  we eventually found out it was in fact brain cancer. my mom just saw the neurosurgeon today and within an hour was in the or to get the big tumor removed.  i'm hoping this will reduce my mom's symptoms and pain.
t3_37no8a-t1_crojkf3-cropxtn	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	you poor thing. i know how you feel.  and while tests may ease your mind, i've had two breast exams in fear that i have breast cancer, and i still worry i have it. as well as i may have a brain tumor. i may have cancer throughout my body and i cannot see it. i had these thoughts before the dpdr though.
t3_3w4kp8-t3_3w4kp8-cxu103h	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	when i realized my grandmother on my mom's side was a pretty horrible person and would most likely be better dead. any time someone talked about an illness she would have to make ones she previously had sound worse. you would say "oh my dad is developing alzheimer's" and she would respond "oh well i had breast cancer and brain surgery." cause she couldn't have certain dietary things like sugar and alcohol she would always complain when other people had it around her even if it was their house. she always had to get into other people's conversations and would get upset if you wouldn't let her. "what are you whispering about?" "nothing" "well screw you then" and she would storm off.
t3_3o65i8-t3_3o65i8-cvujbcx	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7221	stroking my mums forehead as she passed away.  she battled breast cancer for 10 years until finally it got to her brain and she rapidly deteriorated over the last year.  she hated the hospital and held out at home till the last day, honestly i thought she was still going to be around for a long time despite the cancer so when her boyfriend/career called saying she was unresponsive i still didn't realise this was it. we got her in the ambulance and she finally came around for long enough to say "hey boogs27"' (obviously using my actual name though) as though she was trying to act like she was fine. those were last words, possibly last coherent moment.  once she when into the hospice she lasted about 18 hours before she started taking her last breaths, with all of us around her i stroked her forehead like she used to do to me as a child to put me to sleep.  i'm pretty sure her eyes focused on me before in the seconds before she left too, i'm very grateful for that moment, although it was definitely the hardest in my life.
t3_8teod-t1_c0aehny-c0ag1fu	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7927	sorry for length - please trudge through. anxiously await reply.  health care and prescription drugs – two separate issues.   drugs – concede point – canada pays less for drugs.  my brother works for glaxosmithkline (gsk) in the r&amp;d group for cancer drugs. makes big bucks. the us sucks up the r&amp;d costs for the drugs and canada will not. they base cost on manufacturing and distribution. that is the major difference.  when a new drug is released, it is on patent and is charged a large fee to cover the r&amp;d costs, it then goes generic after a few years. they have been opening up facilities in india, singapore and china in anticipation of nationalization. (bro has been to china several times and has moved 6 times in the past 15 years). we will lose the jobs, corporate taxes and fda control when they fully leave. bro will move with them and still make big bucks. this is pretty much a done deal and it no longer matters what i think or want.  health care – i read the articles you referenced. i can counter with numerous articles with the opposite conclusions. (huffington post vs. weekly standard?) you can google “average wait for canada surgery 2009” and read the reputable links (cbc news, toronto sun, edmonton sun, ottawa sun…) try these two canadian government sources:   http://www.health.gov.on.ca/transformation/wait_times/providers/reports/wt_update_20090416.pdf;   http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/waitlist/.  health care is very personal for me. i know the costs well. i have a brain tumor that i get mris (was, 4x/year, now 1x/year thanks to expensive drugs) with no waiting. my husband is type 1 diabetic since age 7 and at the age of 55, reaching serious complications. heart attack, triple bypass numerous stints, osteoporosis w/broken foot, 3 detached retina surgeries. he will have another eye surgery monday june 22 trying to save sight in right eye. he has an endocrinologist, cardiologist and retinologist he sees regularly, not to mention the ent guy and orthopedist he sees occasionally. we have blue cross/blue shield and constantly fight for “reasonable and customary” charges. it is an insane process, but at least i can fight. i can sue. with a government in charge, there is no fight. you get what you get. we pay a lot for his care and sacrifice lifestyle, but he would have been blind 20 years ago without frequent laser surgeries from the retinologist.   canada has good care and excellent doctors, possibly the best there is, but we get immediate treatment here. currently, no government entity makes decisions on whether or not to spend tax money for mri machines or any other expensive equipment or facility. if a hospital or clinic thinks they can make money by having it, it will be there. more demand – more machines – more money. yes, it is greed, but that makes these things available. from the april 15, 2009 canadian government study on http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/waitlist/, the current wait for “other opthalmic surgery” is 108 days with an access target of 84-182 days. his latest detached retina happened wednesday this week and monday he is scheduled for surgery. time is critical for outcome. i will pay any amount necessary for his sight. if we go to nationalized care and he has to wait weeks for treatment, i will pay for him to fly to india or singapore for treatment and figure a way to pay. our poor will not have this option. gsk has built state-of-the-art facilities there and those foreign doctors are well trained.    current worst-case scenario for us: i'm unemployed w/no insurance. spend all savings on doctors and hospitals.  have to sell house. spend that on doctors and hospitals. go on public assistance. get same treatment for husband. left broke but can see. i choose this over going blind because of a 3-month wait and having all my stuff.  if i'm unemployed, i'll lose that, anyway.  canada’s current wait for cancer surgery is 63 days with a target of 84 (great!).  but i don’t want to wait 3 months after finding out i have breast cancer to get that thing out.  i’ll pay anything to have it done now. canadian pediatric surgery – 249 days with target of 182.  if i was canadian and my kid had to wait, i would beg, borrow or steal to find somewhere on the planet that would take him immediately.  the us children of poorest of poor get immediate surgery. it is the law. example: husband’s cousin unemployed, uninsured. 16 yr old son in car accident with liver damage. 3 weeks in fort worth’s cook’s children’s hospital. immediate surgery. private room. no cost to patient or family.  my cousin’s daughter alchoholic 28 year-old unemployed/unemployable in dry-out clinic in little rock (arkansas cares) – no costs to patient or family. p.s. hmo = government care. no recourse. been there, hate that, too.
t3_2skfdm-t3_2skfdm-cnqf38k	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i have stage 4 breast cancer that has moved to my lung. my treatment is being done at a research center i was lucky that i lived near it so it was naturally my first choice. my oncologist has mentioned a few times that cancer treatment is like dealing with the unknown. every person's cancer reacts differently if at all to the different treatments. its natural to have doubts. if it makes you feel better get a second opinion from oncologist. this is your life. also remember this, your type of cancer (each cancer cell   is unique to each person) was successfully treated maybe the previous chemo will still work if not there are lots of types of chemo treatments available not to mention research centers. i'm on my second type of chemo have been on it about 4 months my last scan came back and the cancer on the lung has disappeared still on the breast but it's a start. also my oncologist says that i have breast cancer that has moved to the lung (same cells) not breast cancer and lung cancer (different cells). this means both places are treated with the same drug. your cancer seems to be like mine i don't know for sure because i'm not s doctor. but what i'm saying is there is hope. maybe the original chemo will still work and will treat everything. you must keep hope. not only does cancer eat at your body it eats at your brain mentally, you can't let it do that. if this is the end either 2 months, 2 years or 20 years do you want to spend it worrying and being sad because you are going to die which fyi we all die or do you want to spend it fighting this and enjoying life and those you love in it. my choice is to fight and enjoy those i love. also, if i had not been near a hospital that had an actual oncology department as apposed to a small local hospital i would have done research to find a larger facility. if you are in the us there is funding out there if you don't have insurance to cover it.    sorry this is tl;dr and for misspellings bad grammar, i'm on my phone. don't let the cancer beat you, you beat it until the very end and hopefully it's 20 years from now. by the way your dr in my opinion should not have put a time frame on it because he is not a fortune teller it only added to your stress. one last thing, stay away from cancer websites with all those horror stories no two cancers are alike and neither are the outcomes all the internet will do is bring you down and frighten you.  good luck and i wish you absolutely all the best.
t3_b4k9g-t1_c0kxxlq-c0kxzf7	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	&gt;the attitude expressed by you guys below is why it's hard to find support when one does decide to get in shape.  when one decides to get in shape we are nothing but supportive - kry0s point was that you were promoting the view that you don't need to lose weight to be healthy which is incorrect; the danger of being overweight is hard to spot, i'll quote from sa thread:  &gt;b01] why being overweight is so dangerous  &gt;obesity is the catalyst of several medical conditions: sydrome "x" (diabetes mellitus type 2, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and triglyceride levels) which leads to congestive heart failure, enlarged heart and its associated arrhythmias and dizziness, cor pulmonale, varicose veins, pulmonary embolism, polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos), menstrual disorders, infertility, gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), fatty liver disease, cholelithiasis (gallstones), hernia, colorectal cancer, urinary incontinence, glomerulopathy, hypogonadism (male), breast cancer (female), uterine cancer (female), stillbirth, increased insulin resistance, dyspnea, obstructive sleep apnea, hypoventilation syndrome, pickwickian syndrome, asthma, hyperuricemia (which predisposes to gout), immobility, osteoarthritis, low back pain, stroke, meralgia paresthetica, headache, carpal tunnel syndrome, dementia, kidney failure, stretch marks, acanthosis nigricans, lymphedema, cellulitis, carbuncles, intertrig and joint damage.  - destruction of the body's "hormonal harmony": obesity causes insulin resistance which means that your insulin doesn't work the way it's supposed to. your pancreas tries to compensate by secreting more insulin, but after a while it gets exhausted and you develop diabetes. aromatisation of testosterone to estrogen in fat tissue is a undesirable side effect. fat filtration will also cause the endocrine (hormone producing- insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin) part of the pancreas to respond poorly to hormones, and your natural production suffers as a result. - fat tissue produces different forms of identified and unidentified ï¿½toxicï¿½ substances that have a terrible effect on different regulatory systems in the body, which results in poor regulation of blood pressure (increase) and cholesterol (increase). this predisposes for filled arteries in the heart and brain (heart attack, stroke), by accumulation of oxidised ldl-cholesterol in the artery walls that when absorbing chalk swells up and breaks. - fat tissue inhibits different parts of the immune system, both directly and indirectly, due to inhibition of the signalling roads between immune cells. since your immune system fights cancer cells, the risk for cancer and inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obtrustive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis) increase drastically. - fat is not limited to the subcutaneous fat you see in the mirror. if your obesity reaches a certain threshold the fat itself will 'float' out into your internal organs and start storing itself in your liver, heart, intestines and even muscles. this leads to reduced organ function. - the obese carry a significant amount of weight, while the knuckles, joints, muscles and tendons often are severely undertrained and can't handle it. this leads to premature wearing and damages the skeletal and connective tissue.   tl;dr: obesity will wind you, crush your joints, make you unfuckable and infertile and will eventually slowly and painfully lead to diseases that will kill you.
t3_1xwduj-t3_1xwduj-cffgyq9	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i'm 24 years old, not working but a full-time student who's trying to transfer to university next semester.   my step-mom (mom's so) was diagnosed with breast cancer a year and a half ago. it was early, so she had a double mastectomy performed. she did not received chemo or radiation as she did not want to go through those side effects. her cancer was triple negative, meaning from what i remember that it did not feed off any of the three main things/chemicals cancers tend to. when a cancer does feed off one of those three it's typical to do treatment to reduce said "food" for the cancer, so this was not an option to us.  a couple of months ago, my step-mom lost the ability to move her right arm. a trip to the hospital revealed a brain bleed (pressure on the brain caused the loss) and a few more days and tests revealed that her previous cancer had spread to her brain and lungs. they have no clue where else it may have spread. she just finished her [first?] bout of radiation therapy yesterday for her brain and is about to go back on her chemotherapy for her lungs.  with the return of her cancer, it automatically becomes stage iv. removing this cancer is no longer a goal, but rather the doctors are now looking forward to containing and slowing it.  the healthiest of people can have cancer. sometimes it's genetic, sometimes environmental. my step-mom has never smoked, tries to take care of herself, all of that. this a blameless situation.  what you do is this: take a breath, and take life normally as you can. when your mother seeks help, then offer it; if she doesn't, just make it known that you are there for her. you will and have to face this with her one step at a time, so allowing [or causing] yourself to worry more about the situation and jump to worst scenarios is natural but doing neither of you any good. most importantly, you have to remember this is not a death sentence until there are no alternatives left.  try to get her to learn about what is going on with her cancer, maybe if you can sit down with her to do it. it *is* going to scare her, and you, but knowing what exactly is going on will help her get through it easier.
t3_1f2u1k-t3_1f2u1k-ca6n8tn	brain_cancer	irrelevant	0.7521	watching my mum suffer through 4 years of fighting cancer before loosing her battle this year! 4 years, 4 different types of cancer.   the hardest part was every time we seemed to get a break, thought she was in remission and on her way to recovery, something else would happen. we went from kidney cancer, to breast to brain then bone. the hardest part was the prognosis, every time she went to the doctor it was revised down. her last 2 months were spent in a hospice and i spent all day everyday at her side.   what really got to me was the pain she was suffering at the end. they had to give her so many drugs to keep her pain free that most of the time she was asleep or just not with it. then there was brief moments of clarity where she would tell a joke, or have a laugh with us or even ask us to buy presents for people so they "wouldn't forget her", before she fell asleep again, that really crushed me.   my mum was my hero i wouldn't be where i was today without her and seeing her suffer like that almost broke me. my mum knew this and wanted us to remember the good times so thought of everything. two days after her death my aunty and gran gave me a memory box my mum had made (for both me and my younger sister). she had apparently started if after the second cancer and had pieced together a box of all her memories of us, from our hospital wrist bands from birth, to our first pair of shoes, school reports and countless photos. my mum thought of everyone else above herself even in so much pain, and i only hope i have half as much strength as she had, as no matter how bad it got she never gave up and fought until the very end. she even would not let herself go with me and my sister there, literally hours after i left the hospice she passed away with her sister at her side. she was 49 years old, i'm 23 and my sister is 21 (mum didn't make her 21st) she died so young and her last bit of advice sticks with me "just do it, life is too short!"    sorry for the long post but once i started i couldn't stop, it's strangely therapeutic to write it out. i could say so much more but you get the idea!   edit added her age and mums advice.
t3_1rm40l-t3_1rm40l-cdolfbt	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	info; wanda's family said these past three years have been a painfully, long wait for justice.  wanda campbell's sister louise couch said everyone that knew wanda loved her.  "a good mother, a good grandmother, a wonderful sister, she was just perfect," said couch.  campbell's daughter shirley justen said that is why it is so hard to believe her mother is gone.  "it changed me as a person, you know? i cannot ever get her back and to lose your mother is one thing. but for her to be murdered, it puts it in an entire other category. and you know, you truly cannot process it. your brain just cannot process mother and murder," said justen.  now this family is devoted to one thing. they said finding their loved one's killer and bringing them to justice is their number one priority.  "that is the last thing i told her when i left her at the funeral home. that is the last thing i told her was we would find who had done this to her," said justen.  couch added that she has faith this murder will be solved.  "we are hoping and i am not going to give up hope. one of these days, we will find out who did it," said couch.  kentucky state police continue to help in that search. but at this time, leads are few and far between. still, ksp detective clayton stamper said he hopes tips will lead to a break in the case soon.  "we would be glad to meet with them to see what kind of information they have," said stamper.  until an arrest is made though, justen said it is hard to cope with such a devastating loss.  "i was diagnosed with breast cancer and my first thought was 'i have to call my mother', you know? then the next thought was 'i cannot call her'. you know, i do not have that support anymore," said justen.  wanda's husband roy was a prominent businessman in hazard. if you have any information, you should call state police at 606-435-6069.

t3_1nwo9b-t1_ccmubhx-ccmzzaa	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	* [website 1](http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/08/23/20-medical-studies-that-prove-cannabis-can-cure-cancer/): the first website i came across with 20 studies on it. i'll go through them one by one.   * [article 1] (http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v95/n2/abs/6603236a.html): first of all i don't even need to read the whole article to see the flaw here. the fact is, it's a very small sample here. aside from this only 2 of the 9 patients showed any change. as it states this is a small clinical study. it does not stipulate a "cure" or "treatment" for cancer. it is simply a basis for future research which i am yet to even come across. the type of tumour they are talking about here is a brain tumour which requires surgery to remove and radiotherapy or chemotherapy afterwards. not everyone has success with surgery as the tumour may not be able to be removed. hence why &gt;the patients had previously failed standard therapy (surgery and radiotherapy) and had clear evidence of tumour progression&lt;. this is not to say that radiotherapy or chemotherapy just simply wasn't good enough for them. chemotherapy is this circumstance actually helps 50% of those treated. so i would rather go with a 50% chance of survival than a 22% chance. probably the reason why something like this would not be picked up by the nhs.  * [article 2](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/21/17/6475.abstract): again this is an animal study. it in no way shows that this is effective in humans. it does not show a cure or treatment for cancer. it is simply saying that with the administer of this drug it can reduce the amount of neural damage by 36%. this is not about a treatment after cancer has been diagnosed.  * [article 3](http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/308/3/838.abstract): again an animal study. not a cure. there is some interesting data here but in no way more significant than the outstanding amount of scientific data in favour of chemo or radiotherapy. hence why "doctors don't know about it". they don't know about it because it isn't even a treatment yet!  * [article 4](http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/10/1/90.abstract): this is from a petri dish under lab conditions. not in a human sample. it was also partially funded by a pharma company and included in two patent applications.   * [article 5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20859676): again, in a lab in a dish. as i have said before this is not proof of a cure or proof that it will occur in humans. many many medicines will start with this phase and many will make it to the human participant phase and then show no progression because it simply doesn't work the same in the human body. i am not being negative, just being realistic and open-minded.  * [article 6](http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/early/2006/05/25/jpet.106.105247): these are extracts of cannabis. not cannabis in it's pure  form from which you smoke it. so should i point out that you can't just go and smoke it and it'll have the same effect (another downfall of these "informative" websites). &gt;potential treatment for cancer&lt; are the words they have used in this article. not a cure.  * [article 7](http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/196): this one is slightly more positive but again is not in humans. it uses human breast cancer tumours outside of the person. this is promising.... i say promising, not proven!  * i'm going to stop here because i don't want to create a massive list. please pm me if you've got anymore examples. i'm yet to watch your documentaries.

t3_300mmq-t3_300mmq-cpofqo3	brain_cancer	irrelevant	1.0	i'm glad you are better!!  i *totally* understand what you went through.  i am so sorry your mother was so _______ (many words come to mind, most are not nice) to you.  i went through something similar, but was much older than you -- having to deal with my health &amp; an "n".  the "n" in my life was my nmil (now ex- -- as her son, my nex, are now divorced).  i had been diagnosed with breast cancer a number of years ago. thankfully, no chemo, but i had to go through 2 rounds of surgery, and 7 weeks of radiation. my nmil had something similar 10 years earlier. *however* though i was much younger than her when i was diagnosed and treated -- i did ***not*** do well with either the surgery or the radiation. it seems my body does not like anesthesia -- and all the radiation treatments (not only killed the cancer, but my brain cells to boot -- people often talk about "chemo brain", there is also "radiation brain"). my oncologist told me that i would start to feel tired towards the end of treatment -- but otherwise, i should be fine. ahem … since my body decided it didn't like any of this stuff -- i started to feel exhausted before the end of the 2nd week of treatment. i drove myself to every treatment -- in rush hour traffic -- once my exhaustion was so bad, i nearly fell asleep (passed out on the way home). however, because my then-husband was an n, as was my nmil -- how ***i*** felt was of no consequence. i would have screaming fights with my then-husband because he said his mother didn't have "these problems, issues" why should i? i was much younger? the fights would stop because i got so exhausted, i would have to lie down. my nh then proceeded to mimic exactly what his mother said, refusing to acknowledge how his wife looked/felt. at one point, my nmil/nfil actually said to my face: 1) if your cancer is so bad, then they *should* have also given you chemo; 2) you can't possibly be *that* tired … you're faking it so you don't have to look for a job and go back to work.  i am so thankful i was also going to a cancer support group at the time because otherwise in addition to treatment/recovery -- i would've also thought i was going insane.  an aside: oh, when i was going through treatment is also when i realized my mil was an "n".  i was reading a fiction book describing a narcissistic character (although it was a man, and much younger) -- otherwise the description fit my nmil to a "t".  so i had *that* realization to deal with, along with everything else.  *hugs to you … i hope all is much better now*  edit:  grammar
